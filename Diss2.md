## Teacher Understandings Of Diverse Student Cultural Identities

All the teachers were asked to describe what they knew and understood about the diverse cultural identities of the students in their classrooms. Ms. Carter's reflection focused mostly on identities related to religion, including celebrations like holidays and birthdays, and traditional dress. She asserted that religious identity could have a big impact on the experience of students in her classroom. She mentioned specifically needing to know about students' religions because they relate to how they may choose to dress (or not dress) for her physical education and health classes. She specifically mentioned students wearing hijabs or shoes and attire that were not well-suited for athletics. She described creating work arounds for these students because she would never expect them to change out of their traditional clothing for class. She did not give any specifics on what the dress option would be but made it a point to mention that they would not miss out on class if they could not change into gym clothes. 

Mr. Bowman indicated that his school is very diverse overall, with different religions, races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses represented. He said specifically that his school demographics consist of mostly Students of Color and White students of low socioeconomic status. He takes this further by saying there is a "large group of conservative White students who are in poverty, "hinting at political affiliation as a part of their identity. At his school there is also a very large immigrant and refugee population, with over 60 languages represented. Many students also identify as experiencing homelessness.

Ms. Taylor described her student population as "about half African American." 
The other half of her school could be divided into White students and other Students of Color who identified as Asian, Latinx, etc. She touched on the concept of intersectionality, noting that "the African American experience in the United States is obviously not monolithic. In terms of, um, class status and just subcultures and, and, and things like that." She acknowledged that she teaches a lot of "very well off African American students" and then some who are living in "extreme poverty." Her definition of intersectionality consisted of what she termed "dimensions of diversity." These dimensions reflected many differences such as class, experiences with the justice system (i.e. having an incarcerated parent), and experiences within the state care system (i.e. foster care). Although many of her students come from the same racial background, Ms. Taylor said that these different dimensions impact their experiences overall. She also discussed trauma in the classroom and trauma responses as parts of students' cultural identities. She mentioned that her students' traumatic experiences have led them to be triggered by happenings at school and by other students.

Ms. Taylor also spoke about the high concentration of immigrant and refugee students at her school, saying:
You can't talk about like dimensions of diversity and not talk about like the, there are students from all over the world, um, and they are in all different stages of educational background and language attainment. Um, so we, we have so many students who will less, so after the last four years and the, the limits on refugee students, but certainly when, um, I arrived here, we had so many students who had no prior formal education, like, you know, SIFE kids. And so, I mean that, I mean, you're just teaching them how to do school at 17 years old. 

Ms. Taylor indicated that supporting her Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) is especially challenging. She said that many of them have never been engaged in formal education before attending high school and come from war torn countries in Africa or Asia. She acknowledged that teaching them how to even sit at a desk or interact with other students, especially when they realize that other students in the school may be from rival ethnic groups, is particularly difficult. She indicated that many teachers do not understand these cultural nuances and assume that if students are from the same home country, they must be similar. To this Ms. Taylor said, "no, ma'am, you know, they, they see themselves as really different," something she has realized after frequent conversations with students. Ms. Taylor focused on the importance of opening herself up to students, letting them know that she is prepared to listen if they want to tell her what life was like in the refugee camp or describe for her how their language is different from other students' in the class. 

Ms. Taylor again tied her discussion of diversity to language, indicating that she tries to understand more about discrimination, particularly related to students who come from African nations, so she can get a sense of how they "handle their linguistic diversity." Ms. Taylor expressed that she is constantly working to understand her students' experiences to determine how she can best help them learn and achieve success. Ms. Taylor discussed the belief that she held prior to becoming a teacher that she would be able to serve her students by lifting their voices and helping them to advocate for and express themselves. She noted:
I really thought like me, a White lady was gonna roll up in and teach people like, raise their consciousness is like, whew, that's a little embarrassing to admit, but like, you know, like I, I have learned the longer that I teach that my students already have a consciousness. Ms. Taylor grew to learn throughout her teaching experience that her students have a "consciousness," an understanding about themselves and their experiences of marginalization that is not impacted by her. She learned that she would connect more with students if she listened and followed their lead, instead of assuming they needed help or guidance. 

Regarding her students' cultural identities, Ms. Horton said that "on a very base level, I know that [they are] incredibly different from mine." Most of her students are of a different race than her, and their households look very different than hers looked growing up. As she mentioned before, she grew up in a middle class two-parent household where she was provided with many opportunities in school and beyond. She said that most of her students have lived in the same city their whole lives, and that they have traumas related to racism and low socioeconomic status that she will never fully understand. She said that because academics were always such an important part of her life, she struggles when students do not seem to value education. She did not blame students for their perceived disinterest in school but saw this lack of engagement as a barrier that she works to understand and overcome.

Ms. Horton also touched on the concept of linguistic diversity saying that students' use of their home vernacular can be shocking to some people, including herself. She said that when students speak in ways that are not part of her regular vernacular, she finds herself wondering "Why are we saying that?" She did not dive into any specifics here, but never indicated that she thought the students were wrong or incorrect for the way they speak. It seems more likely that she recognized there is a cultural mismatch and miscommunication, but that it does not seem to impact her classroom in a major way. 

All the teachers presented a multifaceted view of their students' cultural identities. Ms. Carter spoke the most about her students' religious identities because traditional dress related to religious beliefs impacted how students participate in her health and physical education classes. Ms. Taylor and Ms. Horton discussed linguistic identities and identified that their students' cultural norms of conversation and home dialects and languages were much different from their own. Mr. Bowman spoke in the most general terms about his students' cultural identities and was the only teacher to directly bring up political affiliation (conservative) as a facet of students' cultural identities. All the White teachers identified students' racial identities as being different from their own.

## Teacher Recognitions Of Personal Cultural Identities At Odds With Students'

Following discussions about their own cultural identities the teacher participants were asked if there were any times where their identities were at odds with those of their students. Ms. Carter reflected on one situation directly related to race. The incident occurred when she was engaged in the Virtual Instruction Model (VIM). While she was meeting synchronously online with her students, someone put "Black Lives Matter" in the chat. She said that this was right after the U.S. Capitol riots on January 6th, 2021. In response, another student wrote "All Lives Matter." Before she knew it, students started jumping in and posting different color fist emojis or other emojis with different skin tones. She stopped the class and told her students that saying "All Lives Matter '' could be offensive to some students in this class. The student who put that quote in the chat responded by saying that he did not believe in "Black Lives Matter" because they (African Americans) were the ones burning down and tearing up things. Another student noted that the U.S. Capitol riots were mostly attended by White insurrectionists and that only a few of those people were being arrested. The student was alluding to the idea that African Americans are often arrested or killed for their engagement in protests, whereas the White insurrectionists at the capital were not punished (at the time of the incident). Ms. Carter felt that her identity as an African American woman was directly clashing with what her White "All Lives Matter" student felt during this conversation. The conversation fizzled out in that case, but Ms. Carter indicated that it was not the only time that issues related to Black Lives Matter have come up in her classroom. She did not elaborate or provide any additional instances, however. She said that whenever an issue related to race or discrimination comes up, she always stops the teaching of content to hear and address these matters. She affirmed that it is important to her that all students are heard even if she does not necessarily agree with what the student is saying. 

Mr. Bowman recounted two instances where he felt his cultural identity was at odds with those of his students. The first was the incident described earlier in this section related to his identity as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. In response to the false accusations about him coming out dramatically to his students, Mr. Bowman arranged a meeting where he sat down with the student and the assistant principal. He shared his frustration at the situation and expressed hope that the incident could end in a positive relationship for them both. Mr. Bowman described his handling of the issue:
I approached the student and was like, Hey, I'm hearing like some weird things. Like, is there anything you want to talk to me about? And he was like, like, you know, I don't know what you're talking about, et cetera. I was like, look like, I don't really care how you feel about me personally. And I, I just need you to understand that, like, if we are going to continue to have a good, positive, like teacher, student relationship, that like, you gotta cut this out, dude. Like, it's not, it's not gonna, it's not going to make anything any better between us, if you're like lying to people about me. Um, and I can fully attest to the fact that like my personal life has no influence on how well I'm going to teach you. We gotta come to terms with like the I'm going to be a gay teacher and you are going to be a straight student. And we are going to learn from one another. Um, and shoot by the end of the school year, like the kid was like, loved my class. Like he was doing all my work, et cetera. And the same cannot be said for other teachers. Another incident described by Mr. Bowman was when a White student complained about the posters he had hanging up in his room. The student argued that she did not feel like her identity was represented in the posters and even took the issue all the way up to the principal. Mr. Bowman used this as a space to ask the student why she thought there were not more pictures of people who looked like her in the classroom. They ended up discussing privilege, and the reason for having posters that were not of predominantly White students. Mr. Bowman indicated that he heard her point and worked to include images that represented all students in his classroom. The next year he also moved the posters to a different spot in his classroom. 

When asked if she had any experiences that stood out as moments where her cultural identity conflicted with those of her students, Ms. Taylor recounted an incident with an African American male student. She described an issue that took place during one of her "lunch split classes," a period where students attend class for half of the period, go to lunch, and then return. Ms. Taylor said that this class can feel very disjointed since there is a lot of transition throughout the period. The lack of structure causes students to act up at times. Ms. Taylor indicated that the class always needed a lot of redirection, and because this student was surrounded by a lot of friends from the football team, it could just get out of hand quickly. At the time of the incident, Ms. Taylor had a student teacher, who was also an African American male, and she noted that the students seemed to respond quite well to him when she felt the class was really offtask. 

On one day, Ms. Taylor and the student teacher were redirecting this particular student a lot and at a certain point she could see that their critiques and proximity control "rubbed him the wrong way." The student "blew up and yelled a homophobic slur" across the room. The student teacher took the student and walked him out of the classroom while Ms. Taylor attempted to get the rest of the room settled back down. She said that there were several LGBTQ+ students in the room and she could tell they were scared to speak up about how they were feeling. They were clearly upset by the level of anger in the student's voice as he yelled the slurs repeatedly. She said, "students were trembling" and many of the refugee students were confused and unsure of what was happening. 

Ms. Taylor wrote up the student for "hate speech" (what the offense qualified as in the district code of conduct) and upon his return to the classroom a few days later he screamed the slur again. Once again, the student was removed, and Ms. Taylor helped the students left behind in the classroom deal with what had been said. She said that during this incident all the students started looking at a student in the classroom who identifies as non-binary, waiting for them to speak up. Ms. Taylor set up a meeting with the principal, guidance counselor, the student who used the hate speech, and the student's parents to discuss. The conversation did not go well, as the parents supported the student and indicated that they were religious fundamentalists who believed that if a student was "choosing to be gay" they had to learn to deal with the consequences of their choices. They said that it was not hate speech because hate speech only applies to racism and racial slurs. 

Ultimately, the situation was not resolved for Ms. Taylor. The student switched schools and there was never any closure or repair of the relationship. Ms. Taylor said that "it was one of the worst experiences I've had in teaching" because she felt like it was a huge clash of their dimensions of identity. Although she and her student teacher tried to handle it in a respectful way, the damage was done. She regretted not being able to reach the student and indicated that she felt he really needed emotional support and counseling, neither of which she was able to provide. She also reflected on how the situation may have impacted her student teacher, who was put in a difficult position. She explained:
He (the student teacher) was in a really difficult position because like, you know, he could sense that the parents didn't really respect me, you know, as, as, as a White female teacher, you know, but he had high expectations for respectful discourse in the classroom. Um, and they, they really kept to him, you know, like as a, as a Black young Black man, like, well, what can you do? And he's, and, you know, but, but he was going to hold the line that, you know, it was not permitted for students to use hate speech in the school. And, you know, and, and so he was put in a very difficult position that, you know, Black educators are often put into, you know, kind of like living in so many different, having to live in so many different worlds and wear so many different hats. And it's just, it just was a very, very bad situation for everyone. Ms. Taylor's recollection of this incident showed that it impacted her a lot. This incident demonstrated a cultural mismatch that Ms. Taylor believed centered around race and sexual identity. Because she compared her experience with that of her African American student teacher, she was highly aware of how the situation impacted them differently. 

When asked if there have been times when her cultural identity was at odds with her students' Ms. Horton indicated that there have been some minor issues. When asked a follow up question about what these incidents were, she could not describe anything specific. In later questions she described conflicts with students related to beliefs about schoolwork. These mismatches between herself and students related to dedication to course performance and turning in assignments. She felt that certain students were not committed to their schoolwork at the levels that she expected. She did not elaborate on whether there were demographic similarities between these students or any other group identifiers.

All the teachers indicated that they have experienced cultural mismatches that caused conflict between themselves and their students. Ms. Carter, Ms. Taylor, and Mr. Bowman described specific stories whereas Ms. Horton could not think of any specific scenarios. None of the teachers indicated that these incidents made them view their students in a negative light. For all of them, the cultural mismatches were instances where they felt they needed to work hard to get to the bottom of the issue in order to maintain or repair the relationship. 

## Issues Of Diversity And Inclusion That Impact The Teaching Experience

The teachers were asked to describe any issues related to diversity and inclusion that have impacted their teaching experiences. Ms. Carter noted that making sure students have a voice is the issue that most impacted her teaching and classroom management choices. She said that she wants students to know that if they speak up in class, they will never be made fun of, and that their opinion matters. Ms. Carter described feeling very protective when discovering that any student is feeling excluded or isolated. She said that any issues related to bullying are handled swiftly in her classroom. Ms. Carter focused on the importance of providing space for students to speak up and share in restorative circles daily. She reiterated several times that giving students the opportunity to speak their minds is integral to building her classroom community. In these circles, students are asked simple questions like "Is there anything you want to share with the group?" and "Is anyone celebrating a birthday or a holiday this week?" All these questions were intended to help students talk about issues they're experiencing. She explained:
I give them more of the opportunity to share with me what they want to share versus me, like pointing stuff out, because I don't want to embarrass anybody. So, I just kind of open it up if they, if there's anything that they want to share or share with their peers or relate to some kind of way.

This reiterated what Ms. Carter mentioned earlier, that one of her biggest goals as a teacher is to give students a voice and make them feel included. She said that she really prides herself on supporting students so that they feel heard, creating safe spaces where no one is bullied or teased for their unique identity. She added that she allows room for students to share what they want so she does not go into the restorative circles with an agenda or plan for what students will share. In this way, students lead the discussion and discuss only what is most important to them. 

For Mr. Bowman, diversity issues related to visibility in the texts he assigns stood out to him the most. He advocated for issues that face his students such as LGBTQ+ rights, poverty, racism, and classism. He said that making sure students see themselves and their stories in the materials they are reading is integral to his mission as an educator. As an English teacher, Mr. Bowman argued for the idea of "disrupting" things, something he has learned from the \#DisruptTexts movement (Germán, 2020) and other professional development opportunities. He described being a disruptor as taking texts that may be otherwise out of date or seemingly unreachable for his students, like *The Crucible*, and making them connect to contemporary issues like LGBTQ+ rights and the experiences of People of Color. He said that he is transparent with students about the need to re-examine "classic" texts, recognizing that there is more to their own stories and experiences than what mainstream texts display. Mr. Bowman reiterated that he never wants his students to feel like "oh, look, there is another story about a poor Black kid, another story about an immigrant or whatever." He discussed his belief in looking at texts through the perspectives of people of various cultural identities and had hopes of instilling a certain level of empathy in his students to increase understanding and inclusion in his classroom. 

Mr. Bowman also made it a point to discuss how he celebrated different holidays and celebrations in his classroom. One of our interviews took place during February, and he said that "Black History Month is on my mind right now." Making a big deal out of whatever the monthly or daily celebration is a big part of his classroom dynamic. He specifically mentioned Women's History Month, Coming Out Day, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and World Aids Day as various celebrations he included throughout the year to make students feel noticed and welcome.

Ms. Taylor once again grounded her focus on issues of diversity and inclusion in language and conversational norms. Due to the demographics of her school, Ms. Taylor indicated that she has found an intense need to focus on supporting English Language Learners. She said that she wants to make sure that they have appropriate supports and scaffolds so that they can achieve at the same high levels as their peers. Ms. Taylor reiterated that she does not want ELLs to feel as if they are just being given workbooks or menial assignments and noted that it is an ongoing struggle to support these students with their diverse language needs. She did, however, indicate that it is something she is growing in, and has been a huge area of focus for her in her studies. 

Ms. Taylor consistently spoke to her desire to learn more and grow more in the areas where she is not the most knowledgeable. She recalled an instance where at a diversity training, someone told her that she was using cis-exclusive language when she referred to the group as you guys. She took that experience to heart, wondering if she had previously offended other students or colleagues inadvertently. She has worked diligently to clean up her language in that area and in the area of what she calls "Black slang." Until she began the Diversity Literacy Program and took a course in African American Vernacular English in schools, she did not realize she was appropriating AAVE in everyday language. She was not aware that the quotes or slang she was using from hip hop and movies came off as disrespectful to her Students of Color. She vowed to learn more and change these patterns of speech after a few students told her that they in fact did find her use of AAVE disrespectful. She realized "it's not my language," and tried to not use slang or mimic student speech going forward. She modeled for students the way that she might code switch from her own casual register to a more formal language in the classroom. She wants to make sure students know that she "has their back," and that requires her to use her words to "support and to help and to care." 
Ms. Horton spoke about facing issues related to stereotypes, particularly those associated with poor or Black students. She said that she wants students to be the best versions of themselves, helping them to recognize that mainstream media and stereotypes do not define who they really are. Ms. Horton indicated that she tries to find ways to help students focus on their goals of what they want to achieve beyond the classroom. She described helping them to see that they are in a place in their life where they can work through and understand who they really are. She admitted struggling with this interview question, feeling that there's so much to supporting students related to issues of diversity and inclusion.

All the teachers used their understanding of their students' diverse cultural identities as the catalyst for the issues of diversity and inclusion that they prioritized in their classrooms. All of them expressed a desire for students to feel included in the classroom environment. They also all reiterated their hopes for creating a space where students could express themselves genuinely. Ms. Carter and Ms. Horton talked the most about allowing students space to share their ideas and set goals for the future. Mr. Bowman and Ms. Taylor both talked about their professional development opportunities, in particular, how they have worked to learn more about issues of diversity and inclusion that impact the classroom. Ms. Horton and Mr. Bowman also spoke about working to dismantle stereotypes in their classrooms.

## Process For Building Relationships

All the participants were asked to describe what a student would experience at the beginning of the year in their classrooms. This question was designed to get a fuller picture of each teacher's intentional process for building relationships with students. For all the teachers, even Ms. Carter who teaches middle school, students rotated through their classes each semester. This meant that essentially there were two times per year (at the beginning of the year and halfway through the year in January) when they got new students. I began collecting data during the beginning of the Winter 2021 semester (January), so teachers were just beginning to start the process with a new group of students when I first interviewed them. This was an important time to interview these teachers because they were just coming out of a semester with one group of students and coming into a new semester with a different group. This allowed the participants to reflect on how the process went during the first semester and how they were using what they learned to adjust their strategies.

Ms. Carter indicated that she starts every semester with new students with ice breaker games to get to know students, "sprinkled" with classroom expectations. Ice breakers included questions and games where students introduce themselves, noting nicknames or pronouns that they go by. Ms. Carter said that she is very focused on making sure she pronounces student names correctly. She has had students who are going through "gender changes where they're taking different hormones" and so it is important to her that she makes note of any updates from students so that she can call them by their correct names and pronouns going forward. She said, "I cross out whatever is printed and put the name that they prefer."
Ms. Carter said that it is important to mix in learning about procedures with ice breakers. She started the year by playing games and using a restorative circle to get students in appropriate seating positions on the gym floor. This allowed her to combine something fun (a game) with something practical (a seating chart). Within the restorative circle, she asked students questions about how they are feeling or what is new in their lives. When the district was doing virtual learning, Ms. Carter asked the students how they felt on a scale of 1-10 and had them put an emoji that represented their emotions for the day in the chat. She set a goal of making sure that when they left, they could rate themselves at a higher number. She said, "If they come in at a two then my goal is to get them at an eight or higher before they leave." She also made sure to tell them what the class will be like so that they will feel prepared and comfortable. She described to students how they can be successful in very explicit and measurable ways.

Integral to the relationship-building process for Ms. Carter is sharing pieces of herself and her identity with the students. This occurred both inside and outside of the restorative circle. She said that she will "put the content to the side" and share stories with them about her own life and experiences. She let students know that she is a therapeutic foster parent of teenagers ages 12-18 and sometimes her phone may go off. If it is her foster child's school, she told students that she will have to take the call. She described knowing that this resonates with the students, many of whom do not live with their biological parents, or who are in foster care themselves. Ms. Carter has even had experiences where she has been called by agencies and case managers to foster some of her own students. She found it really flattering and an indication of the power of her relationship-building strategies that a student would want to be welcomed into her home and be cared for by her. She said that the restorative circle strategy helped her to gain students' trust since they could see that she is someone who cares about them. A major goal in the early phases of the relationship-building process for Ms. Carter was for students to leave her class remembering that they were cared about and feeling like they received "lifelong advice that I hope that they remember''. As she was describing what she aims to do during the relationship-building process, Ms. Carter mentioned her eighth grade English teacher again. She said that she aims to be like her by serving as someone that students remember, look up to, and hope to be like one day. 

Mr. Bowman also described starting the year with ice breaker activities. He said that his English class is primarily focused on argumentation and they do a lot of work that involves agreeing and disagreeing. For students to be successful there, he argued that there must be a layer of trust that allows them to disagree appropriately with each other. The ice breakers he implemented were typically activities that are low stakes like a four corners strategy where he asked simple questions to get students to agree or disagree with a statement. He started the activity with simple questions like "what color is your favorite" and then moved up to more critical questions like "should people kneel during the national Anthem?" Mr. Bowman said that this progression gives students the opportunity to speak their minds while he monitors and demonstrates expectations for appropriate discussion. Appropriate discussion techniques including waiting your turn and listening to other students' ideas. Mr. Bowman also said that this type of activity helps students to feel comfortable participating in class in the future. He recalled telling students, "Please ask a question! I want you to potentially be wrong because then I can help guide your thinking." He said that he aims to build an environment where students can take risks and feel comfortable sharing their thoughts aloud. 

Mr. Bowman also spent time at the beginning of the year making sure he knew all students' names and that the other students in the classroom knew each other's names as well. To achieve this, he said he puts students into small groups so that they can share or write opinions in a more private setting while getting to know the members of their class community. If a student seems shy or nervous, he described asking them if he can introduce them to the class, and make sure, again, that he is pronouncing their name correctly. He reiterated that he does not want any student to feel like they are "the new kid" or that anyone is staring at them. 

Mr. Bowman worked diligently to set the tone in even the first week of school that he is going to be a "hardcore ally for groups that are marginalized." This is evident in the classroom environment he sets up with diverse posters and sayings around the room designed to help students feel welcome. He argued that "if we're looking at things through an equity perspective, um, those are the kids that have to know that." Mr. Bowman said that it is important to him that students know early in the year that he is someone they can come to with any issues they might have, and that he will be an openminded listener and support. 

Another strategy Mr. Bowman described using is a writer's notebook. Students used the notebooks to write down information about themselves that they may not want to share aloud, and Mr. Bowman always read and responded to their writing. He said he would use a post-it note, or in the case of VIM, would make a comment on their electronic document. He kept his own notes of what students liked so that he could reference these things later with the student. A goal of this activity was to help students see that they can trust him because he kept their writer's notebook private and cared enough to read their work and respond. 

Ms. Taylor focused on getting to know students' names and some key facts about them during the first few days of the semester. She said that this is always difficult, particularly because she has 140 or more students from all over the world. Ms. Taylor kept a spreadsheet with student names, pronunciations, and then facts about them like "what kind of t-shirts they're wearing, what artists they're into, what bands they like, or what color Vans their shoes are." She found that those "little things" helped her to get to know students more deeply because it opened avenues for conversation in the future. 

Ms. Taylor also infused procedures and icebreakers into the relationship-building process. She discussed different principals she has had and the philosophies they held about the first few days of school or a new semester. There has always seemed to be a distinction between "content versus community." She chose to focus on community building through content. For example, she provided students with early works on historical thinking and multiple perspectives, helping students to see that people have always seen things differently throughout history. This mirrored her descriptions of the type of community she wants to create in her classroom where all students feel their voices are valued. She tied these perspectives into the concept of "identity" to help students see that they all have different dimensions to their identities (racial, linguistic, socioeconomic, etc.) that influence how they see and experience things. 

Ms. Taylor described sharing parts of herself with her students so they can get to know her better. She described herself as the teacher at her school that students feel is very "hype" or "extra" and said that it is a "dorky thing that I'm kind of known for." Ms. Taylor described herself as having high energy and bringing enthusiasm to her classroom. She described these as qualities of her natural personality. She joked that students are often saying things like, "Why is this lady being so animated at 8 a.m.?" Ms. Taylor believed that expressing her personality and being enthusiastic about learning helps to create a feeling in her classroom like students are there "to be scholars" and that we are "not here to relax." She decorated her classroom with plants, lighting from home, beautiful art, and essential oils, imitating the environment that makes her feel most comfortable and excited about learning. By being her authentic self, she hoped that her genuine passion and comfortable space made her students feel at peace.

This desire for students to feel relaxed yet pushed towards success was a major element of Ms. Taylor's relationship-building process. She encouraged students to feel comfortable collaborating with each other by modeling the types of classroom discussion she expected from them. She also made it very clear from the beginning that while she is a fun person, she expected students to do work in her class. She believed this "sets the tone," and recognized that there are not a lot of opportunities for "do-overs" if students do not feel engaged at the beginning of the semester. To keep her classroom exciting and focused on the work she said that she constantly "reinvents the wheel" by pushing herself to attend professional development to learn new strategies for engagement. She reflected specifically on one professional development opportunity she had where she was taught intentional strategies for helping students consider their own dimensions of identity. She said, You know, a lot of times students have only thought about like, well I'm a Black young woman or I am an Asian young man. Um, but just to consider the different dimensions that maybe they hadn't thought about and how that really influences them, um, and then, and talk about it, you know, um, and then just kind of, um, you know, establish, establishing norms of communication for when we talk about things that are, um, difficult.

Ms. Taylor said that this exploration of dimensions of identity is important because she wants even the first few days of school to be engaging and challenging for students. As I will discuss further in the later section regarding maintaining high expectations, Ms. Taylor aimed to communicate in the first few days of class that students will be expected to work a lot in her class, but that they would always be pushed in ways that are designed to help them succeed.

Ms. Taylor continuously focused on her desire to help students "critically think about their own dimensions of identity." She believed this not only helped to build community but created early habits and patterns so that students can get to know themselves and understand what helps them achieve and work best. Building engagement and interest in those first few weeks also helped students to trust her, as they learned that if they try hard in her class, it will be ok if they are not successful at first. She told them that she, and the rest of the class community, would always have their backs and would support them in their growth. 

Ms. Horton started her relationship-building process by learning student names. 

She said this was especially hard for her to do at her school because they have a very transient population. This means that it was normal for her to have new students join her class throughout the semester while others flowed in and out sporadically. Ms. Horton kept notes with key details about each student to help her remember names and build conversation later. She reflected on her own teachers saying that "teachers that I looked up to listened to me and asked me questions." She said that she aims to start each semester with a baseline of general student knowledge and then build from there. 

Ms. Horton also used icebreakers and leaned into her personality by being goofy or silly with students. She noted that the goal of all her icebreakers and personalized connections was to "get students to trust me enough to try and push them." This trust included helping students see that "you're not going to let them fail or that if they do fail, you're going to be there to help them, um, and learn from whatever failures there might be." She always wanted to appear "not cold" because she believed that a negative personality can be upsetting to students or make them feel uncomfortable. Ms. Horton said that she aims to make students trust her. Part of the trust stemmed from telling students up front that they would be working hard in her class but that she would be there for them to support them when they struggled. She believed in learning from failure and noted that mutual trust between herself and her students will help them both be successful. 

All the teachers described the importance of learning student names and small facts about students. They all maintained some sort of system for making sure that they are pronouncing student names correctly throughout the semester and keeping track of small details. Mr. Bowman's opening activities mimicked Ms. Carter's as they both infused ice breaker strategies with practical classroom norms and procedures. Ms. Taylor and Ms. Carter spoke about being their authentic selves and hoping that by presenting a genuine "vibe" in the classroom students will feel comfortable and engaged. All the teachers spoke about sharing different pieces of themselves, whether that consisted of previous life experiences or details about their day-to-day lives that students may find interesting. All the teachers also set a framework for high expectations indicating that they will be working hard but never at the expense of students feeling encouraged or cared about. Table 4 summarizes some of the major commonalities across the teachers' relationship-building processes, including examples they described.

## Describing Student-Teacher Relationships

Participants were asked what they considered an "ideal" student-teacher relationship. This question was designed to get a better sense of what the teachers' considered to be markers of successful relationships and relationship-building processes. This allowed me to see if they considered their processes and strategies successful. Ms. Carter responded that an ideal relationship needed to be "professional first and foremost." She mentioned that there are too many relationships out there that are "unethical" and have "nasty stuff" going on. She explicitly stated that boundaries need to be set up and adhered to. These boundaries included not exchanging numbers with students or following each other on social media. She said, It should be a relationship where the teacher is the source of knowledge and the student is open to that. But then at the same time, it's a two-way street also because we can learn a lot from our students. So it's keeping an open mind of, 129 um, you know, anything students that they have to share from their culture, from their background.

She tied her discussion of boundaries back to culture, showing that while there are some non-negotiables in the relationship she has with her students, she wants to make sure that they still are open and respectful. 

Mr. Bowman discussed the idea of "mutual respect." He argued that it is important that he and students have an understanding that they are all occupying a shared space. This meant that everyone needed to be respectful of each other's boundaries. Mr. Bowman reiterated the belief that as the teacher, his goal is to provide students with a service, learning, that must be appreciated and understood. He told students:
You need to take something from my classroom, um, be it like the mastery of the standards, or just like a better understanding of them. Um, but also I'm, I'm here serving you. Um, that's really what I view, like my, my job as is like serving the student. And so like an ideal relationship would be one where like the student is appreciating that I'm trying to give them something.

Mr. Bowman recognized that this appreciation for learning is not always observed and that's where relationships can get difficult. He said that if teachers do not recognize a need to pivot and try different strategies to get students to engage with the learning, relationships can fall apart. For Mr. Bowman, the lack of respect between student and teacher was a space created strained relationships.

Ms. Taylor pointed out that an ideal relationship needs to be "responsive." She described responsiveness as teachers and students sharing ideas and experiences back and forth. Ms. Taylor argued that relationships are reflections of the identities of the people involved in them. Because of this she mentioned that it is important to craft each relationship individually since the needs of each student are different. This belief applied to teachers as well; Ms. Taylor argued that relationships were going to look different if you are a young teacher versus an older teacher, and depending on other aspects of your identity, too (gender, racial, linguistic). These dimensions of identity were something she felt that teachers needed to consider when investigating themselves and their experiences in the relationship-building process.

Ms. Taylor also reflected on the need for teachers to be friendly but not too friendly with students. She also argued that relationships can be strained if the teacher is too far on the other side of the spectrum and appears as too cold or unfriendly to students. She has overheard teachers say things like, "I'm not here to make friends," which she felt was off-putting to students. Ms. Taylor expressed an underlying belief that many teachers struggle with setting up the boundary between being friends and being friendly, and this is often why some teachers shut themselves off from students in a hope to preserve their own feelings. Ms. Taylor argued that this can be a "defense mechanism," something that teachers may do when they do not feel comfortable examining difficult situations or trying new strategies to connect with students.

Ms. Horton agreed that there is a "fine line" in the relationship, and that many teachers flirt with the idea of being "too friendly." She argued that excessive friendliness can cause student teacher relationships to cross a line and be inappropriate. In a later interview, Ms. Horton embellished upon these ideas, saying that when teachers want students to like them too much, the relationship lines can be blurred. For instance, a teacher may lose sight of themselves as the responsible party or disciplinarian in the classroom and lose control of the class because of their overwhelming desire for students to like them. She argued that there is a way to set boundaries and be a trusted person without getting to the point where you are more of a friend than a teacher to your students. The way to do this, according to Ms. Horton, was to make sure there is a "willingness to see from the other's perspective or to work with each other." This included a "mutual understanding of goals" and clarity for the student about what success looks like. She argued that this problem of being "too friendly" seemed to be a bigger issue for new teachers, who tend to confuse being "liked" by students with being trusted or respected. 

There were various commonalities across how the four participants discussed their concepts of ideal student-teacher relationships. Common themes included maintaining a professional relationship with specific boundaries and the concept of a "two-way street" where students and teachers are both learning from each other. All the teachers indicated that these were necessary components of ideal student-teacher relationships and discussed variations within these themes that were integral to their success. Mr. Bowman used the term "mutual respect," which I would argue is like Ms. Carter's concept of a "two-way street" and Ms. Horton's concept of a mutual understanding of goals. Ms. Taylor described the relationship as being "responsive" which reiterates the idea that relationships must be give and take.

## Maintaining High Expectations

All questions related to high expectations were open-ended so the participants could evaluate this concept through any lens. This led to conversations that were focused on holding students accountable to standards and learning in addition to discussions on behavior expectations and safety. In this set of questions about high expectations teachers were also asked about what praise or holding students to high expectations might look like in their classrooms. They detailed their processes for positive reinforcement of high expectations, including specific conversations they might have with students when offering them praise. 

For Ms. Carter, safety was a major goal of maintaining high expectations. Ms. 

Carter has students sit on the bleachers in the gym every day before class while she goes over what they are going to do that day and what the expectations are going to be for safety and success. She tied her expectations for a safe classroom to losing privileges like free play or basketball. She expressed an understanding that for many of her students, physical education is their favorite class and one of the few times in the day where they are allowed freedom of movement. She said that she constantly talks to students "about the time that was taken away from their physical activity and how it was unfair for them, the ones that were running around, how they were taking away time from the students that did want to come in and do the right thing." Through this conversation Ms. Carter aimed to remind students that they are a team, a community, and even just a few students' disruptions (running around) can ruin it (free play) for everyone else. She tied "doing the right thing" to her high expectations which provided an ethical or even moral framework for expectations.

Ms. Carter also identified the use of positive reinforcements as a large part of maintaining high expectations in her classroom. She described providing students with candy like Jolly Ranchers, and said she uses positive phone calls home to reinforce what she wants to see in her classroom. Students received rewards or positive praise for things like being prepared, volunteering to read the learning target, or volunteering to help get equipment or to set up equipment. They were also rewarded for instructional success, such as kicking a homerun in kickball or succeeding in a badminton game. Basically, anything that she noticed a student doing right deserved praise and encouragement so the student will do it again in the future. She also set high expectations for students to take on tasks that they were not asked to do such as working with a shy or special needs student who may seem left out of the activity. Individualized side conversations were also a major tool used to reinforce high expectations to students. Ms. Carter spent a lot of time observing the students in the gym, and when she saw that something was "off" she would pull them to her individually and ask them what they were feeling, if something happened, or how she could help.

Mr. Bowman indicated that even during VIM he maintained the same expectations that he had for students before the pandemic. He described assigning the same amount of work and spending roughly the same amount of individualized time with each student as possible. His concept of high expectations included providing clear rubrics and exemplars for students so that they could be sure of how they were going to be evaluated. Establishing these expectations, he argued, allowed students to be clear about the end goal and helped them plan processes to reach quality final products. After students completed their work, Mr. Bowman made sure to give them consistent feedback tied to the rubric. HE allowed students to redo work that was incomplete or incorrect so that they would reach the set expectations.

For Ms. Taylor, maintaining high expectations was tied to always pushing for student growth. If you were a student in her classroom on the first day of school, she would intentionally create an environment that was both comfortable and "hype." For Ms. Taylor, this type of setting was designed to remind students that "we're here to be scholars" and not to "relax." Telling students that they are scholars was a through line when Ms. Taylor conveyed high expectations. She expected students to achieve at high levels while also inspiring them to trust that she will support them and do everything in her power to make sure they succeed. She was intentional about communicating that "this is a class where we work," and reflected on other experiences her students may have had with previous teachers. She said, I think sometimes, sometimes, uh, teachers, you know, they start real soft and then, uh, then the, then the teacher's like, no, we're going to write an essay. And the kids are like, what? I thought that he was cool, what happened? Um, so I try to communicate from the first day or two, like, we will actually work a lot in this class. Um, but you are so loved and you are so, so, so cared for and supported, but you will have to work a lot. Ms. Taylor said that holding students to standards meant allowing them to be able to access "challenging" and "intellectually stimulating work" to "stretch their brains." Ms. Taylor felt strongly about making sure that these challenging experiences were part of the curriculum for her English Language Learners. She constantly reiterated that it was her duty to make sure students have "support and scaffolds" so that they can achieve at levels like their English-proficient peers. She described her process for helping students reach goals as consisting of "growth," "breakthroughs," and "stick-to-itiveness." She constantly praised persistence and called her students "history detectives." This was designed to show them that learning is a process filled with many dead ends, wrong turns, and incorrect assumptions. She described guiding students to believe that failures are areas for growth and that learning is something that takes time, willingness, and dedication. Ms. Taylor said that she even puts herself in situations to show students that she is comfortable being wrong or making a mistake in front of her supervisors. She said, Even having like the assistant principal, if they're in there for like a walkthrough, or if they're in there to support a new teacher who, you know, is really struggling with management of their classroom, um, with problems, student behaviors, um, I think inviting them in for that, like, it can, it, it's funny to students where, where you're like, you know, Mr. So-and-so, could you help me?

Ms. Taylor demonstrated to students that even adults need to ask for help and that this is not something to be ashamed of. 

Ms. Taylor also used positive praise to reinforce high expectations. She noted that her praise is always very focused on academic skills. A reflection of her upbeat personality, she said she might do something very dramatic to show how blown away she is by a student's work. She described phrasing her high expectations in a way that is humorous and lighthearted. For instance:
I might fall onto the floor and make myself look foolish with a student paper and I'll be like, dang, you won't read this claim! There are flame emojis coming off of this claim! And, you know, I will read the claim aloud and like, students will be like, Oh, that is very compelling. Other times, she said she might hold up student work when a student "tears apart one of our sources or primary sources" so that other students can see them as an example. Ms. Taylor connected with students by making a joke out of her tendency to cuss in class and used this to reinforce high expectations. She said, I know I said I was trying to clean up my language, because I actually do have a little whiteboard that says bleep and I'll hold it up. And I'll say, so-and-so annotated the bleep- and I actually hold up where it says bleep- out of this and the kids will be like, let me see that. And I'll put it up on my doc camera and they'll be like, Whoa, that annotation is clean! Individualizing the praise for achieving academic success was an important part of the process for Ms. Taylor. She described holding up work to have students look at it so there is an element of community praise. She also discussed making sure the praise was specific and tied to the work the student did. She said, "I never say stuff like good job, you know, like I never say things like, oh, you completed this like, completion is not adequate. That is not cause for praise." In some instances, however, she noted that recognizing her students are at different levels is important to how she reinforces achievement. She said for a few of her students, completing a handout might be "cause for celebration." She said, Especially if a student maybe had been struggling and had experienced a lot of growth or some breakthroughs, or maybe just some stick-to-itiveness, I'll often I'll be silly, but I'll still be specific like, Oh, you know, like, so-and-so, you are my, you know, history detective MVP today. Like, thank you so much for, you know, and I might praise the, uh, persistence and recognize that, that they really stretched themselves. Like, oh, my word, like this text gave you grief and you kept going back and you asked your, your neighbors and you use your resources and you crushed it. While she was comfortable praising some struggling students for their effort, overall, she tried to have positive praise and reinforcement focused on academic skills that students were collectively or individually working on. Whether she was praising completion of work or success academically, she continuously used humor and always specifically called out the behavior they excelled at. If one of her shy students was successful, she had a conversation one-on-one with them so that they didn't feel uncomfortable. In general, she said that she tends to have louder instances of praise "to encourage the behavior among the other students." Interestingly she said, "I know we aren't supposed to do that," indicating that she was previously told not to encourage students in front of each other. She said that saying something like "I like the way soand-so is sitting down with their book open" may be perceived as "shaming." She hoped by using this type of public praise to draw attention to students who were doing the right thing in order to inspire other students. Students could see what the desired skill was and then clearly know what everyone ought to be striving for.

Ms. Horton focused on repetition and constant reiteration of expectations. She created videos for her students so that they could feel connected to her and prepared to succeed once they returned from VIM. She never wanted them to feel scared or unsafe returning to school so she did everything in her power to prepare them for what may or may not happen. Ms. Horton very matter-of-factly told her students in these videos that if they had her before, or if they were coached by her, they should know that "we are going to talk about expectations every single day." Even though there was much uncertainty with the COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Horton described being flexible with due dates while maintaining a commitment to high levels of academic achievement. This was an important piece of her goal of holding students accountable. She said, I expect them to work and I expect them to do things and I expect them to, um, you know, achieve for me. Um, but there's also how they do that. Might look a little bit different, um, especially like now. Um, and so it's, it's giving grace and like, I say that there's due dates, but nothing, nothing matters if you, whenever you turn it in is going to be just fine. I don't even mind if you turn it in on the last day.

She described a student who she had seen on her roster for the entirety of VIM but who had never turned in a single assignment. Upon her return to in-person classes, the student gave tremendous effort and worked every day. For Ms. Horton, the personal interaction of being back in the school building was what the student needed to be successful, so she did not hold her lack of virtual participation against her. 

Ms. Horton saw holding high expectations as being "authentic" and maintaining 
"transparency" with students so that they could be clear about what they should do to be successful. She recalled a conversation she had with a student who she connected with in the hallway after the return to in-person instruction:
He's like, 'I did it, I'm out of here!' So I guess he finally finished some classes or finished what he needed to, to graduate. And he was reflecting, 'Man. I don't have to like, worry about all the work you made me do.' And I was like, I thought about that. I'm like, you know what, that's good, that means that I held him to an expectation. I held them to a high standard. I was going to make him work. This wasn't going to be a, what did they call that in uh *Sister Act*? Like the bird class it's just fly right through it. I don't know. I really appreciated hearing that from a kid that a lot of people probably would've never believed would have gotten through this. 

For Ms. Horton, seeing that her dedication to high expectations paid off, especially with a student who she felt was traditionally dismissed by other people, reaffirmed that her strategies were effective.

To maintain high expectations, Ms. Horton intentionally praised student effort. 

She said that she tried to focus on praising effort and not necessarily correctness. This included praising students who showed improvement like when they are "doing the right things or if they were not doing the right things or did not get something right last time, but they made a step in the right direction." Ms. Horton kept praise and reinforcement of high expectations individualized because "praise is different for each kid because whatever each kid is doing or what their level is, is going to be different." She continuously made it a point to find something that she could praise each student for in order to show them that she values and celebrates growth.

All the teachers expressed that there is a necessity to maintain high expectations for all students in order to provide equitable learning experiences. They also all agreed that they must maintain consistency with their expectations for them to be effective. Ms. Carter's view of high expectations had a community element that was not as distinctly observed in the other teachers' descriptions. This was likely because she teaches such a large number of students at one time: her gym hosts around 75 or more students during any given class period. So, having even just two students off task or doing something unsafe could lead to major disruptions. In addition, all the teachers indicated a need to provide positive reinforcements to students, however their descriptions of what this looked like differed. For Mr. Bowman, Ms. Taylor, and Ms. Horton, positive reinforcements typically came in the form of positive praise or words of affirmation. These could even include phone calls home to parents. For Ms. Carter, likely because she is the only participant teaching middle school, positive reinforcements were much more tangible, including things like candy or prizes.
