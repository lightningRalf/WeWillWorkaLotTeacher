## Teacher Self-Perceptions

The findings in the first part of this chapter relate to teacher self-perceptions and align with the first research question, "How do four teachers with certificates in diversity literacy think about their own personal racial, ethnic, and linguistic identities during the 83 process of relationship-building?" The findings reflect the data collected from the four interviews and three self-reflection cycles. The responses to the introductory questions from each teacher's first interview, the focused life history (Seidman, 2019; Appendix A), crafted an image of each teacher as a cultural being and contextualized how they see themselves in relation to student identities and experiences. The focused life history questions allowed me to gain insight into each participant's teaching philosophies and general expectations for how the relationship-building process should occur. As they fit, I layered in pieces from follow-up interviews, self-reflections, and classroom artifacts to the responses from the focused life histories. For each finding I will describe the data from each teacher (case) individually, starting with Ms. Carter and continuing to Mr. Bowman, Ms. Taylor, and Ms. Horton. After a description of individual responses, I will describe cross-case findings. 

## Teacher Cultural Identities: Impact On Their Teaching Styles

The teacher participants took an intersectional approach as they discussed the impact their cultural identities had on their teaching styles. They each parsed out different aspects of their own and student identities that were most salient as they related to specific situations. These included discussions of race, gender, sexual orientation, language, etc. Ms. Carter described her cultural identity, specifically her race and experience as an African American woman, as impacting her in many ways. Ms. Carter described feeling that she needs to consistently work at least twice as hard as her non- Black colleagues to prove that she is capable at her job. She also described needing to be careful about how she presents herself so that she is not stereotyped as an "angry Black woman" or as a "loud ghetto Black woman." The way others perceive her based on her race was salient for Ms. Carter.

Ms. Carter said that her experience as a Black woman growing up in a diverse school herself helped her relate to students. She said, "I definitely have the edge versus a teacher who comes from a community where everyone looks just like them. And so it helps me a lot." As a physical education and health teacher, Ms. Carter used her own experiences to relate to and understand her students. She talked about how athletic experiences varied for her growing up as compared to her non-Black peers. For instance, an activity like swimming was different for her than for her White peers because of issues related to hair. She called upon her experiences as she planned her lessons, knowing that something like getting one's hair wet or dirty is problematic for her Students of Color. 

Mr. Bowman said that "there's no doubt that my cultural identity makes dramatic impacts on my teaching style." He described his classroom as a "shrine to diversity" with pride flags and other symbols to help students know that it is a welcoming environment for them. He described approaching his teaching through a lens of self-growth, including telling students that they are constantly in a process of working on themselves as human beings. Some of his goals as a teacher were to help students learn different things about the world and communicate with each other more effectively. 

As the sponsor for the Gay-Straight-Trans Alliance (GSTA) at his school, Mr. 

Bowman described maintaining an open and inviting persona with students in that group. If asked, he would tell students that he identifies as a gay man. In general, he said that he does not openly express or talk about his identity except when the topic comes up, implementing a relationship boundary related to his personal life. In one of our interviews, Mr. Bowman described a situation where a student spread a rumor about him related to his sexual identity. The student told other teachers and students that Mr. Bowman was very unprofessional, and "coming out" to all of his classes and "crying" to students to about his sexual orientation. Mr. Bowman relayed this story during an interview with the shock and confusion of this accusation still audible in his voice. 

To remedy the situation, Mr. Bowman arranged a meeting with the student and his assistant principal. He asked the student why he would spread a rumor like that and told the student, "I can fully attest to the fact that my personal life has no influence on how well I'm going to teach you." By the end of the conversation Mr. Bowman understood that "this is a 15-year-old kid" with obviously complicated emotions and feelings. After this meeting he had a very positive working relationship with the student and noted that the student said that he "loved his class" by the time the year was over. 

Ms. Taylor described her cultural identity as something that certainly impacts her teaching. She felt that the cultural differences between her and her students caused "bigger problems" at her first teaching placement. At that time, she remembered struggling to find the words to describe the disconnect she was experiencing with her students. She said that she "didn't even know" and that she "couldn't even name it." Ms. Taylor indicated that as a result of confusion she questioned her assumptions and beliefs to better understand the clash. 

In particular, she began questioning her beliefs about the rules for communication that she held based on her "Protestant middle-class norms.'' She explained that "things that I perceived as interrupting or disrespectful, um, I know that that was informed by like my, you know, my, my background." Ms. Taylor shared a specific anecdote where she questioned her linguistic identity. She described memories of African American students coming to her classroom, expressing themselves in a way that she viewed as "being mad and yelling." She recalled that a few of the White students leaned over their desks, almost hyperventilating, indicating that they felt overwhelmed by the noise level and conversational style of their Black peers. She knew that the students' reactions and her own had something to do with a cultural conflict related to race and norms of conversation. At the time she did not have the words to describe this or knowledge of concepts that would help her understand what was happening. This was one of the moments that compelled her to apply for the Diversity Literacy Program. She said that she is a much better teacher and advocate for her students now that she has learned more about cultural norms of conversation.

Ms. Horton described her cultural identity as a "White lady from Northern Indiana" as providing her with many opportunities including access to experiences like college and athletics. She noted that the racial and socioeconomic backgrounds of her students represent experiences entirely different from her education and personal upbringing. She said that from her first days of teaching she was immediately aware of how different she was from her students. She recognized that she needed to understand more about her presence in the classroom and took initiatives to show students her "authentic self." Ms. Horton described authenticity as the key to helping students see who she really is beyond how they may perceive her. She mentioned multiple times that she comes from an experience of privilege that her students likely have not experienced. She reiterated that it is important to her that she does not hide where she comes from or what she has experienced, remaining authentic and true to herself instead of trying to be someone she is not just to fit in with students. She articulated the belief that by being authentic, while also honoring and recognizing the diverse identities of students, she could be an effective teacher despite cultural differences. 

For the three teachers who all self-identified as White, they recognized that their racial identities afforded them privileges and created barriers. All three teachers named their Whiteness as affording them various privileges within school and within their communities and lives. They named privileges that came with their Whiteness including things like safety, security, and access, specifically to things like a college education. Many of the privileges the teachers described were coupled with their distinctions as being middle class or "middle class-ish" in the case of Ms. Taylor. In this way the teachers recognized that race and class are often inextricably linked. In addition, for the White teachers, their racial background and financial standings seemed to be enmeshed. When asked if their cultural identities impacted their teaching style, all three of the White teachers indicated that they absolutely do. Ms. Carter, the only Teacher of Color in the study, indicated that her cultural identity was both an asset and a detriment to her experience. She believed that her race allowed her to connect more with her students who were also mostly of Color. On the other hand, unlike the White teachers, she was the only one to say that her cultural identity, particularly her race, created a dynamic where she felt threatened by stereotypes and an inequitable pressure to achieve at her job. She claimed that this impacts her teaching because she feels like she always needs to be one step ahead of everyone else and working twice as hard to be successful. 

Each teacher identified specific dimensions of their identity to think through how their identities affect their relationships with students. Ms. Carter reflected on her experiences as an African American woman and the way this impacted how she is perceived at her school by other faculty and administrators. For example, Ms. Taylor explicitly mentioned conversational norms as part of her cultural identity that impacts her teaching style. Specifically, she reflected on her experiences with language and conversational norms while teaching middle school, undoubtedly with some regret and hopes that she has learned a lot since then. Mr. Bowman was the only teacher who disclosed the impact his sexual orientation has on his teaching experience. Ms. Horton emphasized authenticity by explaining that while she recognized her Whiteness afforded her many privileges, it was important for her students to see her authentic self. She hinted that this was an identity that encompassed more than just race, but included interests, personality traits, beliefs, etc. 

## Teacher Concepts Of "Respect" In The Classroom

Each participant mentioned something in their interviews and reflections about the concept of "respect" in their classrooms. This was mostly in response to questions where they were directly asked about respect, although at times they brought up respect as it related to concepts like trust or understanding. The reciprocal nature of respect was key to all their discussions of respect. While the teachers were able to give examples of times when students in their classrooms felt respected or disrespected, none of them directly defined "respect." Rather, they described respect as developed and negotiated between teachers and students throughout the course of the year. In this way respect is something to work toward rather than as something finite to grant. They also described respect as being related to one's cultural identity. 

Ms. Carter noted that respect goes both ways. She did not agree with what she called the "sage on a stage" model of teaching, where the teacher is up at the front of a room in an authoritative role, touting themselves as the giver of knowledge. She described respect as a two-way street where one must earn student respect first before expecting the same level of respect in return from them. During the first few days of class Ms. Carter implemented procedures and policies to earn students respect including the use of a restorative circle. The circles were designed for students to share experiences and get to know each other more. As part of the restorative process she asked students questions about themselves. The circles were also used when there was an issue in the classroom that needed to be discussed. During the exercise, Ms. Carter described taking notes to remember information about students' lives in order to bring these details up later in conversation. 

Ms. Carter described building respect as an ongoing process and said that it is her role to both give respect and expect respect from students. She mentioned that many of her students have trust issues or difficult home circumstances and that many of them have a hard time trusting adults. She said that a lot of her students have had experiences where "adults have mistreated them." When asked in a later question about intervening during behavior issues, Ms. Carter indicated that if she sees a student being disrespected, she will step in and handle the situation. She did not give any specific examples here but talked generally about supporting students if they were being bullied. She placed a strong emphasis on the concept of respect in her classroom and made establishing a respectful environment an integral part of her relationship-building process.

Mr. Bowman explained that he starts each year by telling students that "of course" respect is important, telling students:
I know that like first day of school you've heard every single one of your teachers say, um, that their first rule or their only rule is to respect one another. And I say like, look, that's, I think that's excellent, but it's also kind of BS because like what respect looks like to you is not necessarily what respect looks like to me. 

These discussions are designed to engage students in a conversation about what respect really looks like. He said that he does believe respect is culturally situated but that it is still important to define and observe to get all students on the same page. He described co-constructing with students as together they operationalize "respect" by telling students that even though everyone may have a different vision of what respect is, it is still his number one classroom non-negotiable. He pushed his students to arrive at a "real" definition of respect as a class community, knowing that they all probably have unique ideas of what respect means. He did not give specifics as to what descriptions students usually arrive at but said that the "real" definition they come up with together is implemented as a classroom norm and expectation.

Ms. Taylor echoes Mr. Bowman's sentiments that respect is different for each student. It was important to her that she take the time each year to deepen her understanding of what students mean by "respect." She mostly focused on descriptions of instances where students told her that they felt disrespected or that she disrespected them. When she asked students for more clarification in these situations, she was shocked by some of the instances where they described feeling disrespected. She came to understand that respect and disrespect were very subjective and that the terms were used in varied ways by different students. For example, she said that for some students the term "disrespectful" applies to a lot of things, and that it is used as a type of slang to describe something that is unfortunate or annoying. For instance, she mentioned a time when a student said, "that's disrespectful" when she offered them a pencil or said that the fact it was raining outside was "disrespectful." 
While Ms. Taylor understood that "disrespect" could be a slang term referring to a broader concept of something that is annoying, she still argued that it is important to listen to students when they describe feeling disrespected. She noted that she has observed other instances of disrespect that were more generally understood. These instances were typically accompanied by anger or a more heated disagreement. She identified instances that occurred between students from different cultures. For example, when her Somali, Nepali, and African American students have a disagreement it can get heated quickly if they feel some personal slight related to their culture has occurred. She came to view these instances where emotions and voices are raised to be more indicative of when students feel disrespected. While she did not explicitly say what it looks like for students to feel respected, she said that respect is the norm in her classroom. She said that when students feel cared about and not made to feel uncomfortable, there is respect. 

Ms. Horton described a similar view of respect. She argued that respect should be an expectation but that it is not just going to be given without putting work into the relationship. She compared respect to a bank account; one must keep depositing experiences and instances of respect in order to develop something fruitful. Ms. Horton compared a lot of her teaching repertoire to being a good coach or team member. She said that respect comes from showing students that she and other teachers are "on their team," which she further described as being willing to "call someone in." "Calling someone in" means that if Ms. Horton notices a student is disengaged or that they are not following the expectations of the class, she will always address it. For example, she might pull them aside and ask them what is going on. By creating a community with shared values about respect, Ms. Horton said she hopes that students see that they are part of a larger circle of respect and trust.

Ms. Carter and Ms. Horton explicitly stated that you must show respect to get respect. The other participants indicated this reciprocity through their explanations and examples but did not state it explicitly. All the teachers indicated that respect is a process that takes time and must be intentionally revisited, as well as a concept routinely evaluated over the course of the school year. When asked about respect, Ms. Taylor reflected differently than the other teachers; she dove first into what she believes occurs when students *do not* feel respected, which then helped her arrive at a description of what respect *does* mean. Ms. Carter also discussed what it looks like when students are disrespected but she shared a clearer vision than Ms. Taylor about what respect does mean. Unlike Ms. Taylor, describing disrespect was something Ms. Carter brought up later in discussions related to behavior management and not something she discussed when directly asked about respect. For example, she spoke about students feeling disrespected in games like basketball or during other activities that involved competition. Both Ms. Carter and Ms. Taylor said that feeling disrespected caused students to engage in behaviors like raising their voices or becoming agitated. 

## Teacher Concepts Of High Expectations

Teacher participants were asked to describe how they knew when an adult was conveying high expectations to them as a young person. This questioning helped to get a sense of how high expectations were situated in their cultures and experiences. When she was young, Ms. Carter understood high expectations were being conveyed to her when she got in trouble or was spoken to about not turning in assignments or doing them incorrectly or incompletely. She said that her teachers would sit down and talk with her about the task, and "stayed on me" by making sure she fixed the problem before it got bigger. She also said that her teachers would bring up any issues she was having in school with her mom during parent teacher conferences. If anything was ever lacking in her work or efforts in school, teachers communicated with her mom who then took over the situation and was "assertive, having authority over me." Her mother played a major role in letting her know that she was capable of more and supported her through doing whatever needed to be done to maintain good grades.

For Mr. Bowman, when adults set high expectations for him as a young person, he sometimes viewed it as an uncomfortable experience. He recalled times when he produced work that was not up to par and felt upset because that work did not meet the expectations of the teacher who assigned it. He mentioned that he was always the student who wanted to "please the teacher" and it was an uncomfortable confrontation for him when a teacher expressed their displeasure with his work. Mr. Bowman indicated that the experiences were not always negative, and that his teachers were, for the most part, "warm" about their expectations. They communicated what they needed him to do to be more successful the next time. He specifically mentioned that he did not recall many expectations for behavior, indicating that he linked high expectations to academic success and not behavior.

Ms. Taylor's responses about high expectations led her to reflect on her experience being "tracked" in schools. Tracking for Ms. Taylor meant placement into honors and AP courses for high achievers. This experience was something that made her feel like there were not very high expectations for her, because she did not believe she was significantly more capable than her peers. She felt that the teachers' standards in her higher-level classes were generally not very rigorous. At a few points in her academic career she encountered teachers who added a personal element to their expectations, speaking to her about their belief that she could achieve more. One teacher who did this was her eighth grade ELA teacher who was very focused on the writing process and required students to submit written work regularly. Ms. Taylor's teacher required constant revisions of her work and she remembered this feeling different from her experiences in other courses. In other classes, she said that she was not interested in making sure her work was done well or completed, saying "I was usually the kid, like I did it, here's my worksheet." But something was different in her ELA class where the teacher not only expected her to do the work but to do it correctly and with maximum effort. 

Her ELA teacher would say things like, "this is good, but it ought to be better." 
She also used nonverbal communication to demonstrate her expectations by showing displeasure with facial expressions or proximity control. Ms. Taylor said that she thinks about this teacher when working with her own students. She described applying her experiences as a student of feeling pushed to success to how she demonstrates high expectations for her students. She also expressed a belief that tracking systems often put high achieving students into classes where they are not set up for success. For instance, a student may be high achieving in math but a struggling reader. Nonetheless, the school may place the student in all AP classes despite challenges in English. Ms. Taylor felt this system was problematic based on her own experiences with it and what she saw in her school.

Ms. Horton's insight into what she believed about high expectations also stemmed from her experiences as a student. Her high school English teacher told the students at the start of the semester that they would know how to write a five-paragraph paper by the time the semester ended. To achieve this, the teacher made them write a paper every single week. The teacher's feedback, reading every single paper every time, was integral to Ms. Horton's sense of expectations for quality work. Her teacher always commented on the paper, and if she came to this teacher for support, it was always offered. Ms. Horton said, "I talked to her about [things] that I didn't talk to anybody about like a friend or parents." She made a connection between high expectations and a strong teacher-student relationship by saying that because the teacher made herself available for support, she found herself coming to her to just talk about her personal life. 

All the teachers indicated that an important element in their understanding of high expectations as young people included wanting to please an adult or make them proud. Ms. Carter indicated that in addition to wanting to make her mother proud, she also wanted to make sure that she did not get in trouble and to avoid her mother "staying on her." All the participants described teachers or authority figures who held them to a standard and refused to let them drop below the expectations. This included making them revise work until it was done correctly or reminding them that they were capable of more. In this way each participant believed that their teachers would not let them fail. None of them described adhering to high expectations as a negative experience, but instead as something that felt firm and reassuring. In all their experiences, the teacher or authority figure who set the expectation helped them to reach goals such as successful completion of a task or earning a high grade on an exam. All the teachers considered the way high expectations were conveyed to them when creating processes for relationship-building with their students. In the second part of the section, I describe how the teachers navigated student cultural differences while maintaining high expectations.

## Teacher Concepts Of Care

When asked how she came to understand when someone was demonstrating care for her Ms. Carter reflected on an after-school program in fifth grade. She called the program "charm school" as it was essentially an etiquette club for girls to understand social concepts like how to set a table, how to eat properly, how to cross your legs in a dress, etc. The leader of the program was a parent who volunteered her time to teach the class. She saw how much this adult cared about the club and realized that the parent probably worked a full-time job and then took their time to come to the school to teach children who were not even her own. This had an impact on Ms. Carter because she felt like the parent was really putting the children's needs and learning first, and she respected her for devoting her time and knowledge to them. 

Ms. Carter also talked about an interaction with a counselor in her junior year of high school where she felt truly cared for. She was having a difficult time adjusting to the culture shock of transferring to an all girls' Catholic school. She had a very low GPA and was not adjusting well to the new school. Her counselor met with her and was dedicated to making sure that she was successful. The counselor recognized that there was a social element to why she was struggling to achieve and so she helped her find a group of friends. The counselor sat down with her to have one-on-one conversations and made sure that Ms. Carter knew she was always there to help her feel good about being at the new school.

The importance of a one-on-one element was something Mr. Bowman reiterated in his reflections on care. He indicated that you could tell someone cares about you when they go out of their way to ask you how you are doing or when they express that they are worried about you. This included an adult noticing when he was not acting like himself and checking in on him or offering him support. For Mr. Bowman, a big descriptor of someone showing care revolved around the individualized attention they give you, which allows for a more vulnerable interaction. He said that by having a moment alone with someone you can really feel comfortable expressing what is on your mind and connecting with that person more fully. 

Ms. Taylor also discussed the need for care to be felt on an individual level. She described this as a "feeling of full attention." As a teacher, she said that she recognizes how difficult it is to give a young person undivided attention when you have many students. She reflected on how spectacular those teachers and authority figures that gave her their full attention were, since she can see now how difficult that is. She described a feeling of trust and community emanating from those instances where her teachers would focus solely on her and her well-being. She called this an intentional process of creating a "vibe" where students know that they are being cared for and paid attention to. 

Ms. Horton said that she felt cared for when her teachers would be excited to see or hear from her. She connected with those teachers who spent time getting to know her on a deep level. Listening was important to Ms. Horton as a student; she indicated multiple times that she knew teachers cared about her when they heard her out or brought up information that she discussed with them later. This showed her that they were listening to her and valued her input. She mentioned how important she felt when teachers would ask her about how she fared in her latest sports competition or how she was feeling after a torn ACL. Remembering these small details helped Ms. Horton feel as if she was the sole focus of the teacher, which in turn, made her feel uniquely cared for.

When the teacher participants were asked about how they came to understand when an adult or authority figure was demonstrating care to them, they spoke about previous experiences they had as students. A general commonality was that conversations that demonstrated care had to be on an individual level, where the young person felt like they were the sole focus of the conversation and teacher's attention. This meant that the teacher listened to them and brought up key parts of the conversation later to show that they remembered important facts about them. Their descriptions also included their teachers spending a significant amount of time with them. This individual element was something that they all mentioned intentionally including in their own processes of relationship-building because it was so impactful on them as young people.

## New Learnings Influencing Teacher Beliefs

Ms. Carter identified various learnings from her Diversity Literacy Program that impacted how she builds relationships with students. She mentioned educational strategies and new concepts that she learned in these courses and now implements in her classroom. From one of her classes she recalled an image of two students standing on different sized boxes. Seeing this image and learning about the difference between equity and equality changed her teaching practice. In particular, she was able to use this concept to see the importance of incorporating tools for differentiation. For example, she began using different activities like stations that allow student choice and ownership of learning. She indicated that the courses where professors modeled the strategies were the most useful for her. When she could practice the strategy in her course it stuck with her more, and she was more likely to use it in her own classroom. Ms. Carter emphasized that she still reflects on her course materials and picks strategies from her courses to use routinely with students.

Other courses Ms. Carter took in the humanities, specifically those related to pan-
African studies and women and gender studies, also impacted her beliefs and teaching practice. She mentioned one course where she learned about gender stereotypes and how they impact a person's experience. These new learnings helped her to more clearly understand the needs of her LGBTQ+ students, particularly those who were going through a transitional period or who were switching to their authentic names and pronouns. Ms. Carter focused on the importance of student names in many of her interviews. She discussed calling students by their authentic names and pronouns as an integral part of her relationship-building process. She made it a point to do this even when their name differed from what was listed on official school documents and records.

Mr. Bowman said that much of his educational foundation came from courses he took when pursuing his bachelor's degree, but that various courses in the Diversity Literacy Program were also important. A public schools in America course and an African American English course were the most impactful. The public schools in America course was a foundational class designed to help students understand the framing for public schools. He said this class started the conversation within him that there were several educational inequities that needed to be addressed for him to be a successful teacher. One of those major inequities was standardized testing. Mr. Bowman reflected on a conversation he had with his class on biases found in standardized testing. One of his students brought up that he had heard tests like the ACT were skewed towards White, middle- and upper-class students. Although Mr. Bowman knew the research well from the readings assigned in his classes, he expressed hesitancy to confirm this belief for students because he did not want to create another source of anxiety for them. He said that "with the population of my school that can be pretty daunting to understand while you're about to engage with this test." After giving it thought, Mr. Bowman's response to students was to first let them know that yes, this is unfortunately how many tests are structured. He wanted to first make sure students were getting correct information. But then he wanted students to understand that despite test bias, they needed to keep going as so many structures (i.e. college admissions) rely on assessments. Mr. Bowman did not stop there, telling students:
We can disrupt that. Um, like let's try to do our best...and understand that, like, it's not going to change the entire rest of your life trajectory. Uh, if you do what you would perceive to be poorly. And then too, like if we continue to like, be loud about that then like, or about the issues of bias, then perhaps we can do something about it eventually.

It was not only the new knowledge regarding bias in standardized testing that Mr. Bowman found helpful, but it was also the ideas surrounding disrupting inequitable school systems that helped him during this conversation with students. 

The African American Vernacular English course Mr. Bowman took helped him to see that students in America speak in different varieties and dialects. He realized that it was important for him to know about those distinctions to understand his students more fully. Especially as an English teacher, he felt that knowing about how students communicate was going to help him better support them in their reading and writing. Another course he took that was influential to him was focused on students experiencing poverty. Knowledge gleaned from this class helped him continue to understand the different experiences and perspectives of students in his classroom. He used this knowledge to build broader pictures of his students so that he could support them through issues that might result in educational setbacks. 

For Ms. Taylor, the course she took on African American Vernacular English in schools had a profound impact on her. The class helped her rethink the way she sees herself, her students, and her instructional decisions. It helped her to see ways that she could "honor" students' language practices and conversational norms to build better relationships. She said, I need to understand, um, more about like subcultures within the Black community and like different registers and nonverbal communication and things like that, you know, like, uh, you know, a lot of the African Americans that I hung out with, they were, you know, they were middle-class, they were college educated or, you know, working in professional settings. I dunno, like maybe, maybe, maybe they just used a different register when we were around our mixed race, peer groups, you know, I don't know.

The course made her question her previous experiences with People of Color and gave her a deeper understanding of the intersections between class, race, and language. In another course she was in, a fellow student remarked that they do not use terms like "Sir" or "Ma'am" because they felt like that was "slave language." She had never heard of this before but reflected on this to better understand where the person was coming from. Because of her new knowledge from the AAE course, her mind had been broadened to ideas about linguistic diversity and what is considered respectful conversation. She was more open-minded to the student's ideas and considered this thinking about "Sir" and "Ma'am" in her own classroom discourse.

Ms. Taylor also mentioned a course she took before the Diversity Literacy Program in her Master's in the Art of Teaching (MAT) program. She said it was a crosscultural competency course where "you read all the biggies": Nieto, Ladson-Billings, and White Teacher (Paley, 1979). She said *White Teacher* is still a text that she thinks about frequently to this day:
Although old and somewhat dated that, that pierced me, like to my core. Like I remember like reading, like I thought that if I carried around, um, these, these, I think, I can't remember quite the quote, but like I thought if I carried around these suitcases that said 'liberal' on the outside, I didn't have to open the suitcase up and see what was in there.

Her emotion at that quote was palpable, and she is still amazed at how much she learned in that class. She mentioned that the professor was probably as impactful as the texts, if not more. She felt like all the readings assigned really helped her process and learn, and that the professor's no-nonsense attitude encouraged her to do and be better. She recalled a time where she told the professor she was struggling with making lesson plans, and the professor told her to "put on her big girl pants" and just get the work done. She remembered thinking "Did she just say that?" before realizing that comment was the motivator she needed to sit down and work. Through her descriptions of the professor, it was clear that Ms. Taylor aims to emulate the "tough love" demeanor of a teacher who has both high expectations for students but supports them to get the job done. Ms. Taylor believed that her new learnings influenced both her beliefs and class practices. 

Ms. Horton indicated that all the diversity literacy courses were influential for her and provided her with new knowledge. She said that they were impactful because they deepened her understanding of herself and her identity and made her realize how her experience related to issues of inclusion in the classroom. She reflected back on her first courses in her initial teacher certification program prior to the DLP and noted that those courses covered some of the same topics, but that as a 21 year old they did not "hit" the same way as they did in the Diversity Literacy Program. With multiple years of teaching under her belt, she was able to see the impact of the issues she was learning about and use her new knowledge to create change in her teaching.

Learning from a women and gender studies course on the feminization of poverty and the Black family was most influential for Ms. Horton. She said the course gave her:
Time to think about some historical pieces...why there are these wider structures, why there are systems, why there are the stereotypes in place. Um, cause that's never something that I've had to think about.

Learning more about the LGBTQ+ community, which is something she felt very unaware of, helped her to think about the intersections of her identity. She said, Stuff that I literally wouldn't have ever known about. Um, I mean, well, maybe I would have known about, but like had a, uh, it was a, there were so many eyeopening things that I like academically learned about, but also just socially learned about.

Ms. Horton noted that in response to some charged incidents in her school and community, she was revisiting texts and learnings from the Diversity Literacy Program related to trans rights and supporting trans students in schools.

All the teachers overwhelmingly indicated that the experiences in the Diversity Literacy Program provided them with invaluable new knowledge. Earlier learnings in other programs related to diversity were also impactful. All the participants described using knowledge from the DLP in their classrooms. They reflected most on topics that changed the way that they thought about their students and their cultures. Ms. Carter was the only teacher that explicitly mentioned the courses providing her with specific strategies and not just new knowledge. The other teachers noted that they use knowledge from the courses in their classrooms, presumably to craft strategies and teaching processes, but did not say this explicitly. Ms. Horton was the only participant who noted that the timing of her courses in the Diversity Literacy Program was important to her understanding and retention of the topics. She had taken various diversity courses in a previous program when she was younger but did not feel like they were as useful for her. This was at least in part because she did not have any teaching experience to tie the concepts to.

## Teacher Perceptions Of Students And Navigation Of The Relationship-Building Process

Findings in this second part of the chapter focus on the teachers' perceptions of students and the relationship-building process. They align with the second research question, "In what ways do teachers describe how they navigate cultural differences to convey sentiments of high expectations and care to their students in order to build positive relationships?" The participants' responses focused on how they translate their unique identities into their relationship-building processes. The findings show how each of the four teachers perceived the students in their classrooms and how they describe their processes of navigating students' diverse cultural identities to build positive relationships. Responses include their beliefs on the relationship-building process generally, including their ideas of what an ideal student-teacher relationship should look like, in addition to specific strategies and techniques that they used. For each finding I will describe the individual teacher's related responses followed up by various cross-case findings.
