## Individualized Attention: Targeted Caring And High Expectations

All participants recognized that their perspectives of high expectations and care differed from those of their students. This difference was never viewed as a deficit but as something that could be used to build relationships with students and develop classroom norms and systems. As mentioned previously, care and conveying high expectations are often found intertwined in the literature. Aligning with this, many of the teachers' descriptions of intentional strategies to demonstrate care also functioned to convey high expectations. A common thread among the teachers was that conveying high expectations and care needed to be done in an individualized way to be the most effective. This looked like speaking with a student in a one-on-one situation or learning about how the student prefers to be interacted with and honoring this preference in interactions. This aligns with Tosolt's (2009) findings that sentiments of care were most effective when conveyed on a personal level. 

One strategy discussed as an important part of teachers' relationship-building process was being intentional to learn student names and pronounce them correctly. The importance of knowing students' names appeared in the literature on culturally responsive teaching (Nieto & Bode, 2012). Kohli and Solórzano (2012) argue that viewed through the lens of Critical Race Theory, mispronunciation of student names in schools supports "a racial and cultural hierarchy of minority inferiority" (p. 2). Names are special markers of culture because they have family and cultural significance, and many students can trace their names back to ancestors or important figures in their family's history. When names are mispronounced in school, especially when the student has repeated their name several times and the teacher does not attempt to learn correct pronunciation, it brings the importance of the students' unique identity into question. In addition, it can be seen as a lack of care on the part of the teacher. Kohli and Solórzano argue that mispronouncing a child's name in school is often seen as "benign" (p. 5). Using CRT to look at the larger context of race and racism, this microaggression can have a "cumulative impact" (p. 5) on the way a student perceives themself and the quality of care their teacher has for them. 

Ms. Horton indicated that she was intentional about greeting each student at the door during the first week of school. During this time, she asked each student how to properly pronounce their name and looked for students who seemed lost or confused. Ms. Taylor also placed an emphasis on calling a student by name, organizing the names of her 140 or more students into a spreadsheet with a printout of their picture and a small detail about them. This organization of details helped her get to know them superficially, but she used these simple noticings to invite further conversation to "know them on a deeper level." 
In the beginning phase of relationship-building, each teacher indicated that they intentionally took individualized notes about each student and brought up what they noticed over time to show interest in getting to know each student. Ms. Horton started by asking students general questions which helped her to find something to tether the students' names to, to help her remember them quickly. For Ms. Horton, learning a small piece of information about a student bred a "spark of connection," something she indicated was important to begin the relationship process between teacher and student. 

When it came to maintaining high expectations in an individualized way, Ms. 

Taylor constantly reminded students that she loved them, but that they would have to work hard in her class. She did not allow for cutting corners, though many students come to her with low levels of English understanding. She said she believes it is on her as the teacher to create systems for high expectations with scaffolds so students can move to higher levels of understanding. In his conversation with the student who accused him of "coming out" to his classes, Mr. Bowman also demonstrated firm expectations for student success. He was blunt and straightforward with the student that he was not going to hide his identity or demonstrate less care for the students since they seemed to be at odds, but that he was going to be a good teacher, nonetheless. The effectiveness of this conversation was evidenced by the outcome; the student clearly understood the situation better and became a high achiever in the class.

Ms. Taylor's efforts also display concepts of high help and high perfectionism as described by Ferguson (2008). In Ferguson's model, high perfectionism was the push for correct answers, and high help included a significant amount of work on the teacher's end spent making sure students met the expectations for correctness. For Ms. Taylor, many of her strategies contained very deliberate levels of scaffolding, where she showed students how to complete tasks step-by-step. This was particularly true when Ms. Taylor discussed the supports she provided for her English Language Learners. She discussed needing to "stretch their brains" by assigning them the same work as native English speakers, but with high help strategies like sentence starters, essay scaffolds, and translation tools as needed. She was clear with students that they were going to probably fail a few times before they get it right, but that this is part of growth. She expected them to eventually meet her expectations for success. 

This model of high help and high perfectionism is like the experience Ms. Taylor described having with her eighth grade English teacher. She recounted in her focused life history that the teacher not only expected her to do the work, but to do it correctly and with maximum effort. The English teacher would often say things to her like, "this is good, but it ought to be better," a mantra similar to what Ms. Taylor reinforces with students.

Ms. Horton tied conveying care to building trust and providing support to her students. In particular, she saw building a strong relationship as foundational to her ability to maintain high expectations for her students. This enmeshment of care and high expectations was reflective of caring as defined by Hayes et al. (1994). In their findings, African American students described positive interactions with their teachers in the areas of helping with academic work, encouraging success and positivity, and responding to individual needs. Ms. Horton's efforts mirrored this structure: she was creating a connection and then supporting students with their academic work to "build that mutual trust where like a kid knows that I'm, I'm there for their success and for them to, to succeed." Ferguson's (2008) high help high perfectionism model, demonstrated as effective in classrooms where Students of Color are more than 75 percent of the student body, posited that "any condition other than High Help with High Perfectionism was associated with a particularly large decline in student effort and persistence" (p. 3). Ms. Horton's descriptions of building mutual trust through consistent support and intentional focus on goals were in line with Ferguson's model.

Feedback was necessary for high help and several of the teachers described giving specific feedback to students. Ms. Taylor described incorporating a free write activity into social studies, similar to the tasks Mr. Bowman assigned students in English. She provided students with an image or a short text and encouraged them to "respond and then maybe think about something from their own life." Like Mr. Bowman, Ms. Taylor pushed back against a linear focus on "dominant discourse, which is informed by an unnamed white racial habitus" (Inoue, 2015, p. 16) by encouraging students to incorporate their voice into their writing. In terms of feedback, Ms. Taylor found that incorporating short writing activities coupled with immediate feedback encouraged students to complete more work correctly over time. She remarked that students "would look back and be like, dang, I wrote two paragraphs!" She reminded them that if they could write two paragraphs today, what would stop them from writing more in the future? In this way, the high help (specific feedback) was often the impetus for space to encourage high perfectionism (writing more next time). 

Slaughter-Defoe and Carlson (1996) discovered that students felt teachers really cared about them when they made themselves available, comforted them, and demonstrated concern about their life issues beyond the classroom. Ms. Carter held private side conversations with students who she perceived needed support. She said that she routinely asks students, "Is there something that happened? Are you feeling some type of way?" in order to get to the root cause of what was troubling them. Oftentimes, she found that issues related to their home lives including a lack of sleep was the reason. Duncan-Andrade (2007) argued that a truly equitable education required specific attention to the needs of a community through embracing the "sociocultural richness of the community as a resource, rather than as a barrier to be overcome" (p. 618). For Ms. Carter, engaging the community involved constantly checking in with students and giving them intentional time and space to reflect on their home experiences. Instead of seeing their issues at home as outside of her scope of support, Ms. Carter recognized that in many ways she could not teach students effectively if they did not feel safe and heard, reflecting the positive experiences she described, recounting that her teachers would frequently talk with her individually about anything she was struggling with. She recalled that they "stayed on me" by making sure she fixed the problem before it got bigger and appreciated that her teachers took the time to involve her mother in the conversation for additional support. 

Ms. Horton also discussed the importance of individual expressions of care. She reflected on her own experiences, noting that she felt cared about when her teachers listened to her, and when they brought up information from conversations later. This demonstrated to her that they were not only listening, but that they *heard* her, and found her ideas and concerns important enough to return to later. Ms. Horton focused on an intense dedication to each students' interests and likes when building positive relationships. Mr. Bowman and Ms. Taylor also indicated that they felt cared about by teachers who gave them their full attention and asked them about experiences outside of the classroom. They said that these were specific strategies they used in their classrooms daily to connect with students.

## Relationship Boundaries

Participants indicated that a key component to their relationship-building processes was establishing clear boundaries with their students. Each noted a point when they needed to assert and clarify boundaries. Ms. Horton said that she did not feel comfortable with all conversations related to her personal relationships. Aultman at al. (2009) referred to this need for teachers to identify the "appropriate" boundary between what they disclosed about themselves to students and what they kept private as a communication boundary. They discussed the idea of a "professional transaction" (p. 6) which must be in balance for teachers to create a safe and comfortable class environment. Ms. Carter and Ms. Horton described a boundary related to personal relationships, particularly relating to their partners or anything that could be construed as related to sexual relationships. They insinuated this boundary by saying it was important not to get "too personal" (Ms. Carter) or *"too comfortable"* (Ms. Horton) with emphasis added. 

Ms. Horton said that for many teachers, the professional versus friendly dynamic can be confusing, as they may equate students liking them with respecting their authority. Mr. Bowman felt comfortable using terms like "friends" or "friendly" to describe the relationships he had with his students. He discussed how he refers to all his students as "friends." When pushed on this, he indicated that "friends" is a term of endearment, a way to avoid using gendered language to get the attention of his students (a replacement for something like "you guys," "ladies," etc.). In this way, he is not necessarily equating students to his actual friends but is using a general term to describe them as a group that he cares about. 

Schutz (2014) described this relationship boundary between being "friends" versus "being friendly" as something teachers, especially new teachers, must identify. Mr. Bowman did not see the use of the term "friends" as removing his authority or control. He argued that this terminology works because of his personality and the inclusion of other tools he used to maintain his identity as the adult in the classroom. An interesting relationship boundary that emerged from Ms. Horton's commentary is that at some point in her career she realized that it was not effective to consistently worry if students "liked" her or not. She saw this desire to be liked as being an issue with many new teachers; she argued that they often strive for a friendship with students and get offended when a student does not like them or their class. Ms. Horton came to an understanding that for her to hold high expectations there are inevitably going to be times when students are not happy with what she has assigned or required of them. For her, the boundary between "friends" and "friendly" was clear: she and her students are not friends, but she cares about them deeply. Based on her past and current experiences with athletic coaching, her relationships mirrored the "mentor" role identified by Schutz (2014). This type of relationship boundary positioned the teacher in a role more akin to a parent or counselor, someone who had the best interest of the students at heart but is not afraid to insist on appropriate behavior and accountability. 

Schutz (2014) described the type of realization Ms. Horton came to as part of a teacher's ability to "read the room" (p. 7). Eventually, there came a time in a teacher's career where they became more effective at thinking on their feet, part of which revolves around not taking student criticism or student misbehavior personally. I would argue that this ability also stemmed from a teacher's understanding of diverse cultural identities, and one's capacity to recognize that sometimes misunderstandings come from a disconnect and not a personal attack. This recognition of cultural misunderstandings was something teachers in the study reiterated as well.

## Flexibility And Adaptability

For all the participants, the COVID-19 pandemic required them to renegotiate standards and expectations with their students in order to create meaningful learning experiences. Each teacher maintained high expectations while working to be flexible and extend grace to students. In this way they further enmeshed care and high expectations by focusing on student needs without sacrificing learning. Participants also maintained the belief that part of being flexible and adaptable meant finding individualized supports for their students. 

Mr. Bowman told students that he thought it was important to "revisit all of our standards, give every student an opportunity to, um, demonstrate mastery in each of those standards." This demonstrated his adherence to high expectations in an individualized way. It was important for Mr. Bowman to take time to check in on each student and provide them with an individualized plan for success by keeping detailed notes about which standards each student mastered and following up with them to ensure their success. 

Ms. Taylor indicated that during the pandemic, "none of us really knew the right thing to do." She remarked that she was "still full speed ahead teaching actual content" but that it had to be simplified due to the logistics of being virtual, particularly due to time restraints and not seeing students daily. Flexibility meant focus on "breadth rather than depth '' to maximize performance on the AP History exam. She indicated that information from the district related to high expectations for academic content retention seemed to be incongruent with other district communications. She noted that the school and district recommended a focus on social-emotional learning because of the stress of the pandemic. She agreed with the need for this focus but felt she could push both academic rigor and social-emotional support in her classroom. Ms. Horton's administration had a similar sentiment towards the return to in-person learning, indicating that there needed to be a certain level of "grace" afforded students. She described flexibility with due dates with a commitment to work completion. She linked this to the concept of "authenticity," and said she needed to be transparent and "real" with students. So, while she valued grace and flexible due dates, she was not willing to put aside learning. Instead, she scaffolded assignments and requirements so that students could keep track of their work and deadlines.

Participants each made note of a district initiative for student assessment. The district began a portfolio initiative in 2018 for students transitioning to middle, and high school as well as 12th grade graduation. This Backpack or initiative, a type of portfolio, required students to create and upload artifacts to a digital platform, each item demonstrating what they had learned at different grade levels. The goal of the portfolio was for students to describe which assignments over the course of their learning career helped to prepare them for success in the future. The portfolio acknowledged success in five distinct areas, and students must gather artifacts to demonstrate proof of learning and growth in each area. This initiative required the teachers to be flexible in their assessments to meet the requirements laid out by the district. 

As noted previously, Ms. Carter indicated that she lost much of the autonomy she normally had in the school's pursuit to support this portfolio initiative. Because she was covering classes instead of teaching physical education during the return to school period, she ended up supporting students who needed artifacts for their portfolio. This meant that she could not hold the high expectations for her course content as attention was diverted to this initiative. Nonetheless, she felt compelled to make sure students were committed to high expectations in this portfolio initiative, despite her obvious frustration at having been unable to teach her own content after the return to in-person classes.

All teachers also demonstrated a general flexibility to adapt their content to the needs of their students beyond the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. They all indicated a desire to teach to their students' interests. The teachers' focus on student interest demonstrated an element of interdisciplinarity, tenet six of Critical Race Theory, which focused on sharing the experiences of people through various content areas (Martinez, 2020). For instance, in Ms. Taylor's social studies classroom, she routinely incorporated current events and local news that she knew was important to students' lives. As mentioned previously, Mr. Bowman made it a point to tie required readings to modern issues as well. 

Diversity Literacy Program Learnings and a Commitment to Social Justice Participants indicated that engagement in the Diversity Literacy Program and a continued commitment to learning more about social justice and issues related to diversity were important to their success as educators. Tenet eight of Critical Race theory is a commitment to social justice, which is the through line in the teachers' discussion of their learning. Through the lens of this tenet of CRT, findings from this study illuminated how four teachers described the ways in which they used knowledge of their own cultural identities and those of their students to build positive relationships and explored the ways in which teachers aimed to transform the relationship-building process through deeper understanding of the power structures at play. Likewise, findings demonstrated how the teacher participants considered the effects of institutionalized and systemic racism or various "otherisms" (sexism, classism, etc.) on the relationship-building process. Much of their understanding of these concepts came from their experience in the Diversity Literacy Program or through other classes and professional development. 

Kleinfeld (1975) argued that one of the main reasons White teachers are considered ineffective is because they perpetuate hegemonic viewpoints and even "personify antagonistic values" (p. 304) of oppressive White culture. Ms. Taylor brought up instances where she knew her understanding of different cultures was at a deficit, and she recognized that she needed additional knowledge and support. As described earlier in the middle school conversational styles example, she knew she needed to understand more about the way her students were communicating, and why it felt amiss to her. As she indicated, an impetus for her enrollment in the Diversity Literacy Program was her realization that she was not effectively serving her Students of Color because of gaps in her own knowledge. By taking courses related to different varieties of English, she felt she was able to move herself towards a deeper understanding of her students' cultural identities and how these shaped their learning. 

Mr. Bowman reported that his understanding of biases and inequities in education, like standardized testing, helped him to be more authentic and transparent with students. He was able to calm their fears while also providing them an avenue for "disrupting" systems of oppression. He did not shy away from confirming their beliefs about inequity, but instead, offered his allyship and support to challenge the status quo, demonstrating a level of critical consciousness. This also demonstrated his understanding of tenet one of Critical Race Theory, the idea that race and racism are permanent, and that discrimination is a "normal" part of society (Delgado & Stefancic, 2001, p. 7). Solórzano and Yosso (2002) noted that social justice must have a focus on both eliminating racism and other forms of discrimination, while aiming to empower minoritized groups. Mr. Bowman demonstrated critical consciousness pedagogy by being transparent with his students about discrimination in public schools, while also working with them to find practical ways to empower them to find success. This can also be seen through the lens of CRT (tenet two) which is a challenge to dominant ideologies. In this example, Mr. Bowman questioned policies and practices that aimed to be neutral but that he felt were grounded in "white supremacist beliefs and practices of meritocracy" (Martinez, 2020, p. 11). 

Ford and Sassi (2014) demonstrated that a White teacher's approach to authority was similarly effective as a warm demander if certain other criteria are met. Importantly, White teachers must "prioritize interpersonal relationships, communicate in culturally congruent ways, link care with justice, develop a critical race consciousness, ally with students, and critique curriculum" (p. 39). The incident with his student who was uncomfortable with the multicultural posters in his classroom showed that Mr. Bowman was intentional about how he approached student/teacher conflicts. If a student indicated that they felt left out, he was willing to make changes to support them. However, if a student actively criticized someone's cultural identity, even his own, that matter was handled in a more direct way. This spoke to Mr. Bowman's self-identification as an "ally," and showed that he was both understanding and committed to social justice.

Ms. Taylor argued that many teachers seem to enter the career hoping that they can change their students for the better by helping them help themselves. This might look like a savior complex where they viewed student success as exclusively attributed to them. Over time Ms. Taylor realized that as a "White lady" she likely had unintentionally (and embarrassingly, as she noted) tried to make her consciousness (her White racial habitus) that of her students'. In this way, prior to her learning more about her students' cultural identities and realizing that they did not need to be fixed or steered in the "right" direction, aspects of her White performative identity obscured her understanding of the consciousness students already possessed.

Participants reflected on educators who made an impact on them when they were students. They sought to emulate these exceptional teachers but remained tied to the belief that they needed to adapt their instruction to meet the distinct needs of their students. This reflection on their previous experiences as students and their cultural identities was an important finding. It indicated that the teachers modeled their teaching off what they had perceived to be successful when they were students, while renegotiating their cultural identities and experiences as young people to determine how they could best support their students. By combining what they enjoyed and experienced as students with their understanding of the diverse cultural needs of their students, the teachers enmeshed old and new in their classrooms. 

All teachers articulated a commitment to social justice by their descriptions of engaging in classes and professional development throughout the school year and during their time off. The district required teachers to take at least 24 hours of professional development annually, but many of these hours were fulfilled by mandatory days or through school-based programs. All participants noted that they always accrue more than the required amount of professional development for the year, oftentimes even before the school year begins. They all indicated that they engage in these additional courses, many of which were on social justice topics, and learning opportunities on a volunteer basis out of their desire to be better and learn more.

In his professional development Mr. Bowman looked for opportunities to learn more about contemporary texts and became deeply interested in the \#DisruptTexts movement (Germán, 2020). He also planned to attend an acceleration training in the summer that was designed to focus on class interventions for struggling students and had professional development scheduled to work with his content peers to build systems and standards-based content for the next year. This included training with a local community college on how to support students looking to earn remedial college credit. He said that he volunteered for these trainings because he viewed himself as a teacher leader in his building, and even when he did not volunteer for something, he was usually asked by his administration to do it because they also viewed him as a leader.

Ms. Horton had signed up for several restorative justice professional development opportunities over the summer in addition to a few that were science specific. She was a member of a literacy cohort at her school and attended professional developments on literacy learning in different content areas. When asked if these were required trainings, she said that they were just sessions she signed up for based on what she found interesting or useful. 

Ms. Taylor described pushing herself to attend professional development to learn new strategies for engagement. She reflected specifically on one professional development opportunity she had where she was taught intentional strategies for helping students consider their own dimensions of identity. When asked about her plans for the summer she discussed a professional development opportunity she was doing in order to teach a dual-credit Pan-African studies course in the upcoming year. She was also planning to attend the National Teachers for Black History Conference in addition to completing 12 hours of developing curriculum for a civics class. She was part of a district social studies cohort building a history curriculum about historically Black neighborhoods in the city. 

Ms. Carter described needing to "keep up with what's going on" and wanting to 
"learn new ideas and new practices, techniques, anything to help me." In our last interview, she discussed using her summer to attend courses on best practices in her content area, restorative language, and technology. She planned to work at the local Boys and Girls Club tutoring and taking students on outdoor adventures to local parks, the zoo, and aquarium. When asked why she chose to spend her summer this way instead of taking a break or relaxing, she said "I never had a problem with doing professional development. Any chance to learn from my peers and best practices, I'm going to take advantage of that." This showed her commitment to bettering herself so that she has the best tools to further support her students. 

Participants also indicated a desire to continue in their careers as educators. Some discussed wanting to move into administration, while others were looking into additional programs or opportunities for advancement. Mr. Bowman had plans to begin a second professional degree, one which would allow him to become an administrator with the goal to create change outside of his classroom. He also mentioned a vested interest in educational policy, with a potential interest in working within the school district or state offices. Ms. Carter was also looking into an assistant principal program. The other teachers indicated that they would be interested in a continuing degree, but that they were not quite sure what that would look like at this time. 

## Implications

This study extended the literature on teachers' intentional processes of building positive relationships with students with diverse cultural identities. It supported a need for ongoing learning and reflection with an expectation for changing practice. Specifically, findings demonstrated how care and conveying high expectations were key components of this process. This is important because research indicates that students who feel challenged and supported are more successful in school (Hayes et al., 1994; Teven & McCroskey, 1997; Tosolt, 2009). Findings also provided a framework for thinking about vulnerability, as part of the negotiation of power dynamics within the relationship-building process. This study also provided insight into how a group of four teachers described maintaining flexible processes for connecting with and challenging students during a global pandemic. The conclusions suggested that deeper knowledge of self, student cultures and experiences, and intentional relationship-building strategies were important tools for teachers to utilize in their classrooms. To gain access to and successfully implement these strategies and philosophies, it was important to reconsider teacher education courses and programs and professional development opportunities for teachers to include these. In this section I will also describe further research that this study implicates.

## Teacher Education Programs

All participants indicated that their practices were positively influenced by their new learnings in the Diversity Literacy Program. They expressed teacher humility at learning new information and constantly reiterated that they were learners in their experiences. They described an expectation that they should do something with their new knowledge, putting their learnings into practice. While this study was not designed to serve as an analysis of the DLP the data references participants' perspectives of how the content from the program shaped their teaching. 

A limitation of this study was that the teachers were all part of the same degree cohort and came into the program, and therefore this study, with a certain level of interest in learning more about social justice and enacting culturally responsive strategies in their classrooms. This was a limitation because it cannot be assumed that most of the teaching force comes into the profession with an interest in social justice and culturally responsive teaching. Therefore, the White teachers in this study may not be representative of the predominantly White teaching force at large. This study demonstrated that the participants had a willingness and desire to increase their knowledge related to anti-racist, equitable education and implemented what they learned in the program after they graduated.

This finding was important because it provided insight into how programs like the DPL could be expanded. First, program organizers could consider the use of peer or administrator recommendations to help identify participants to apply who might otherwise not express interest. This might help in the matter of engaging more teachers who may not readily express a willingness to engage in diversity work like the program entails. By creating a system of "calling in" as Ms. Horton refers to it as, more teachers may feel a sense of belonging in their district and schools. Darling-Hammond (2015) demonstrated that countries where teachers felt that their profession was valued had higher levels of student achievement. In addition, these nations also tended to invest in more "high-quality" (p. 4) professional learning. Perhaps the correlation between being valued and engaging in high quality professional learning could have a positive impact on some teachers who are hesitant to engage in this type of learning. By being "called in" by someone they know, they may be more likely to participate in a program that feels outside of their comfort zone.

Another possible addition to programs like the DLP could be an element of mentorship related to what the teachers are learning in their classes. For instance, perhaps teachers in these types of programs could be required to commit to mentoring a student teacher or a new teacher in their school in the years when they are enrolled in the program and/or for a certain period of time afterward. This could increase the impact of the program by opening space for at least twice as many teachers to be well-versed in the concepts teachers are learning. It could also help to advertise these types of programs to teachers who do not self-select to do them on their own, perhaps enticing them to apply in later years. It could also open an additional avenue for self-reflection, where participants could evaluate their own processes for educating and supporting their colleagues. 

Other policy recommendations include changes for reworking content around diversity literacy in preservice and inservice teacher education courses and when this content is taught in the sequence. This includes rethinking teaching of concepts related to diversity including content on building relationships with students. Many teacher education programs incorporate content related to multicultural students (Bennett, 2012), however Cochran-Smith et al. (2015) argue that much of the content is not sufficient to make fundamental changes in the thinking of preservice and inservice educators. Vavrus (2017) argued for greater capacity building for teachers through implementation of critical pedagogy. Critical pedagogy was defined by Darder, Baltodano, and Torres (2003) as an active process that required teachers to investigate their assumptions and beliefs on topics like political and historical claims and social justice. 

To implement critical pedagogy in teacher education programs, candidates and practicing teachers need readings and learning experiences designed to move them away from perpetuating deficit perspectives about students. Exposing teachers to concepts like the White Savior Industrial Complex (Cole, 2012) is one strategy to unpack existing deficit perspectives. Many teachers go into the profession believing that their "good heart" and "good intentions'' (Aronson, 2017, p. 39) are enough to make them successful teachers of Students of Color. However, this type of thinking can lead to dysconscious racism (King, 1991) where one has a distorted view of race and racism that does not allow them to acknowledge their own privileges or hand in systems of oppression. Moving beyond this type of thinking is especially difficult for teachers when many courses promote deficit-framing scholars like Payne (2005) and Jensen (2009) who describe students and Communities of Color as lacking. To ensure that outdated and debunked scholarship is not being perpetuated in these programs, review processes should be implemented to routinely review syllabi and course materials. 

In condensed preparation programs like the alternative certification program Ms. 

Horton was a part of, teachers are working full time while earning their degree. Like Ms. Horton mentioned in her interviews, it can be hard to focus on diversity concepts when you are trying to learn basic teaching skills like lesson planning. In this way, basic pedagogy concepts and diversity literacy may appear as different skills instead of aligned. Ms. Horton said that she did not feel like the diversity information "hit" in her original M.A.T. program because she was only 21 and teaching full time while earning her degree. What she was learning in her courses she was immediately applying in her classroom the next day. In such a frantic and stressful situation, it is not surprising that many teachers dismiss the diversity concepts as "extra" and focus on what they consider more immediate needs like designing assessments and grading. Ms. Horton said that "four or five years of teaching under my belt, working in a school, and also just growing up" caused the DLP to be more impactful. 

To support this notion of teaching as a career-long learning process, programs, along with state and district level certification entities like the EPSB in Kentucky, should explore continuous learning requirements that specifically attend to a commitment to social justice. For example, maybe within three years of teachers' initial certification, they would have to take a certain number of diversity-focused courses as a condition of retaining their certification. This would allow teachers to have time to gain classroom experience before they revisit topics related to equity and inclusion. 

Teacher preparation should also maintain a commitment to diversity standards. 

For example, educator preparation programs must adhere to the InTASC Model Core Teaching Standards and Learning Professions for Teachers in creating and aligning their syllabi (Council of Chief State School Officers, 2013). Programs should focus on the standards and sub-standards related to supporting diverse learners in their classes for preservice and inservice teachers. This might require deeper alignment between these standards and course syllabi and increased and up-to-date training for university staff. 

To better meet these diversity standards, more education programs should both ensure diversity concepts in course content and experiences in programs as well as through other disciplines. For instance, preservice and inservice educators could be required to take a certain number of courses in the humanities or sociology to complement their regular education courses. Taking diverse courses like this used to be a norm in education programs but was removed in favor of more focus on strategies and classroom management. Course options, like those in the Diversity Literacy Program, related to pan-African studies, women and gender studies, history, and philosophy can expand their knowledge of content and of inequities and systems of oppression. Preservice teachers and early career teachers could then apply understandings from these courses to their lesson planning and classroom structures to build solid foundations. This would also reinforce the idea that diversity, equity, and inclusion are essential to effective pedagogy and not "extra" components or afterthoughts.

As an adjunct faculty member of a teacher preparation program, this study has led me to reconsider content and delivery of diversity concepts in the courses I teach. I plan to include a more salient element of critical reflection in my courses, which includes promoting an awareness of self and personal identity. This might look like frequent journaling or discussions on what is going on in teachers' classrooms. I especially plan to revisit the materials we use to make sure none of them are perpetuating deficit perspectives. Further, I will instruct students on the dangers of the deficit perspective or to help them recognize it in their practices as well as school and district communications and policies. 

I want to invite students to engage in a "pedagogy of possibility" (Simon, 1987, p. 

372) described by Simon as "an educational practice whose fundamental purpose is to expand what it is to be human and contribute to the establishment of a just and compassionate community" (p. 372). Enhancing their critical consciousness will push them to see where and how their biases are standing in the way of supporting students' success while developing candidates' asset-based pedagogies (López, 2017) which more effectively support historically marginalized students and Students of Color (Morris, 2017). By focusing on students' cultural identities as essential elements of concepts like quality lesson planning and equitable assessment design, teachers can serve as cultural workers who "contest dominant forms of cultural production '' as they work to develop a pedagogy of possibility (Simon, 1992, p. 39). 

## Teacher Professional Development

Because this study focused more on new learnings and experiences from the Diversity Literacy Program than outside professional development, this study gleaned only a few implications related to this topic. The teachers described how there was often a disconnect between theory (their learning in the DLP and beyond) and the practices implemented in their buildings. In the future, participants in programs like the DLP could be invited to be more active in district professional development design and delivery. For example, in the district where the teachers work there were policies and professional development opportunities created and enacted for racial equity. With knowledge from their diversity literacy course experiences, members of the program could offer special sessions drawing from their experiences and learning. This could help to not only broaden the reach of the program, but also serve as "calling in" new teachers to engage in practices that support diverse learners. 

When asked about their plans for the summer, all the teachers indicated that they had very robust plans for professional development. Most of these were through outside organizations or at national conferences. Some of the professional development opportunities included content knowledge, restorative justice, bullying prevention, literacy, curriculum development, and technology. Very few were school or districtsponsored, indicating that they were committed to staying on the cutting edge of what is happening in the broader educational community. 

The next focus addresses what the findings demonstrate about professional development generally. First, teachers should have more time to reflect as a part of their professional development experiences. An important feature of meaningful teacher learning was the dedicated time to sit with what they learned and think. For example, the participants critically reflected on themselves and their experiences related to their cultural identities. Furthermore, their new learnings about social structures and systems of oppression that impact their students fostered deeper considerations about their classrooms and instructional choices. 

Something else to consider when designing professional development is the interaction educators have with individuals outside of the profession. Several participants made remarks about things they learned from other students in their DLP courses. Ms. Taylor in particular spoke about how one of her classmates dismissed the use of "Sir" and "Ma'am" as "slave language." This was something she had never thought about before, and although it was not directly taught to her through the coursework, the exposure to different people and ways of thinking helped her consider something new. Therefore, it would be helpful if teachers were required to attend professional development with others who are not teachers to provide exposure to content and perspectives that differ from their own. Future Research This study implicated future research in the areas of advanced and preservice teacher education programs, professional development, and district policies. While the scope of this research did not include an intensive focus on district policies, it would be informative to look at how these participants, or future participants, view and utilize district policies. For instance, are any of these teachers participating in or leading professional development using the knowledge and skills they obtained in the Diversity Literacy Program? Are they contributing to work on district policies or part of advocacy groups? 

Extending the current study or future research, the participants might explore if they are consistently attending and/or conducting professional development based on what they have learned and purport to value around relationship building and high expectations. Mr. Bowman presented his final project to his principal, and some of his ideas and findings were used to structure school-wide strategies for discipline and behavior management. The participants said that they are often asked to provide professional development or lead school initiatives based on their diversity literacy knowledge and continued learning opportunities. Ms. Horton was part of a larger team at her school involved in a program designed to increase literacy practices across content areas. She routinely led professional development at staff meetings and trainings throughout the school year. Perhaps in addition to a required mentorship component of programs like the DLP, there could be a required professional development component. This would require teachers in these programs to share their learning in more formalized district-sanctioned learning spaces.

Several of the professional opportunities described by the teacher participants did provide additional compensation. The participants did not describe this compensation as a reason for attending professional development. Darling-Hammond (2015) found that when teachers feel valued in their careers, student engagement is likely to go up. Linking value to compensation, it would be worthwhile to investigate if the tuition remission from the DLP and payment from professional development opportunities led to a desire for continued learning.

These implications question how preservice and inservice teachers can be supported to continue to learn and grow. In particular, how can teacher educators and professional development create a space where teachers want to learn and understand more about equitable educational practices, particularly with a teaching force that is predominantly White and does not personally benefit from the elimination of systems of oppression? For the teachers in this study, it seemed that they already came to the Diversity Literacy Program with a desire to learn more and be better. But what about teachers who may not be looking for programs like this one? How do teacher educators and administrators engage teachers who seem otherwise content with their initial certifications and degrees in continuing coursework or professional development? 

Another question this study raised is how to retain teachers like those in this study who have a desire to learn more and become leaders in their building and district. Is the goal to keep them in the classroom, or to encourage them to be administrators or officials who oversee and educate other groups of teachers? The COVID-19 pandemic only exacerbated teacher shortages in high-need areas and generally across schools in the United States (Cardona, 2021). The United States Department of Education pointed to three key areas for teacher retention in a recent letter to school leaders: increased wages for school staff, hiring and maintaining quality substitute teachers, and increased support for educator and staff well-being. 

Teacher well-being was not an overall focus of this research, although at various times in our interviews the teacher participants expressed frustration about district and school policies. Most notably, Ms. Carter was very upset by her school's treatment of her and closure of her classroom during the pandemic and VIM. Future research could explore whether there is any correlation between teacher well-being and ability to form positive relationships with students, or between teacher well-being and commitment to social justice and professional growth. 

A limitation of this study was that there was not a control or comparison group to look at to determine what teachers who *are not* using intentional strategies to build positive relationships with diverse students do. Perhaps a larger district-wide study of professional development opportunities for teachers participating in continuing education could answer some of the questions about how to engage all teachers in a commitment to social justice, equity, and inclusion. This might look like interviewing teachers who consistently attend professional development beyond the required hours to see if this has an impact on their ability to build positive relationships with students might provide evidence needed
