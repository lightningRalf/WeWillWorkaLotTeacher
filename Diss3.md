## Demonstrating Care

All the teachers were asked what it would look like in their classroom if they were intentionally demonstrating care to their students. For Ms. Carter, showing care began with something she noticed about a student. She said that she might say to a student, "you don't seem to be happy today, is there anything you want to talk about?." From there, she said she would treat each situation differently by going "off of the energy that they give." She described paying attention to the student's body language and, when needed, would sit with them for five minutes or so not saying anything. Then when students started divulging their issues to her, she reminded them that everyone has bad days and told them "I have bad days too." She said that she tries to offer them a solution or determine what kind of support they have outside of school. If she got the sense that they do not have a support network beyond her classroom she would ask them if they would like support from the mental health counselor. She said that she always asks students first if they would be comfortable with her referring them to a counselor. If there was a more concrete issue like their water or electricity has been turned off at home, she took steps to help them get in touch with the community liaison who supports issues like that. She reiterated that her support is individualized and that it is important for her to treat each student like an individual case so that they feel personally listened to. She said, Whatever they tell me, I try to help. And then not only that I'll go back and I'll follow up and then I'll say, you know, how did that work out? Did you, were you able to get some shoes? Were you able? And follow up with them. That's important too. For Ms. Carter, following up was a key part of showing students care. She made it a point to revisit the issue with the student in a few days and check that it was resolved. If it was not, then she helped them find another solution that worked better. 

Mr. Bowman said that he relies on simple approaches like asking students "is everything ok?" or letting them know "I'm always here" if he gets the sense that something is going on. He said that he tells students, If you want to let me know of anything that's like going on like a fab, uh, or if you want to like, talk to me about how I can help you out a little bit more, like, here's my planning period. This is my lunch period. Um, or like, you know, I'll be here until 3:30 today or that kind of thing. Um, I think for the most part, it's making myself available to a student. For Mr. Bowman, it was important to find opportunities where he could meet with the student individually to show that he cares. He noted that there is also a distinctly personal element to where he will plan to meet with them. He said, I'll usually try to find a place where the student will not feel vulnerable. Um, like I'm not going to just like pop down by their desk in front of another group of students during independent reading time. And, um, say like, Hey, how's everything going on going at home. Um, but I'll, I'll try to set up an opportunity for me to have some one-on-one time with students. Making himself available and meeting in a space where the student feels more comfortable were important to Mr. Bowman's process of demonstrating care.

Ms. Taylor said that the way she chooses to demonstrate care depends on each individual student. She described comparing her students to their "baseline," making a note of when students act outside of their normal behavior. If they seemed to be acting unlike their usual selves, Ms. Taylor used the information she gathered throughout the year about each student to have a conversation with them about something that they care about. If the student's behavior was causing them to be off task then she would tie their behavior to their goals. She posited that she might say something like: 
I know you told me that you wanted to join the Coast Guard and I worry that, you know, or I, you know, I know you, you said to me, um, that it was really important to your, your auntie, that you are on the honor roll. So I might kind of center it into, into some sort of detail that the student had shared with me that I had worked hard to remember. Ms. Taylor actively used the key details she knew about each student to make them feel cared about. It was important to her that students knew she addressed them on an individual level and that she is invested in their success and happiness. 

Ms. Horton found it important to demonstrate care in a private way. She did not want to draw attention to students when they were feeling upset because she recognized that likely what is bothering them is something that they do not want all the other students to know about. She described "pulling up beside them, getting down on their level" or times when she will "sit down at a chair next to a kid." Proximity was an important key element for Ms. Horton's demonstrations of care. She was frustrated with the onset of COVID because she was not able to incorporate this element anymore. Once she established a private space, she asked the student general questions like "Hey, what's going on?" showing that she notices that something is off. She said that she would reference how they normally act, saying things like, "You seem angry or you seem sad or you seem like you're usually doing your work today and you're not doing it today. What's going on?." These short questions were designed so that she does not draw attention to the issue because she recognizes that some "kids are hypersensitive to that kind of thing." In this way, Ms. Horton used the information she already knew about each student to determine how she should approach them when attempting to support them through a difficult feeling or situation. 

All the teachers indicated that their demonstrations of care require them to understand a student's "baseline" as Ms. Taylor calls it. It was important to all the participants to have a general understanding of how students normally act so they could sense when something is off. They all described noticing how students are feeling and making it a point to check in with them consistently. All the teachers also indicated an individualized element when talking about demonstrating care. It was important for all of them to connect with students in a physically safe space where other students would not be able to overhear the conversation, and where the student could be safe to express themselves. Ms. Carter specifically mentioned following up with the student to make sure their problem was resolved. The other teachers indicated, although did not state specifically, that they made it a consistent routine to check in with students.

## Chapter 5: Discussion And Implications

This qualitative study described how four teachers understood their own cultural identities and how they used these understandings to build positive relationships with students whose cultural experiences differed from their own. Additionally, the findings identified how conveying high expectations and care were reported to impact the process of relationship-building. The research questions that guided this study were:
1. How do four teachers with certificates in diversity literacy think about their own personal racial, ethnic, and linguistic identities during the process of relationship-

building?

2. In what ways do teachers describe how they navigate cultural differences to convey sentiments of high expectations and care to their students in order to build positive relationships?
Using the IPA approach to conduct a follow-up analysis of each participants' process of meaning-making related to relationship-building allowed me to "examine convergence and divergence" (Smith et al., 2009, p. 3) in the sample. For example, by asking all the teachers about their beliefs on the concept of respect in the classroom, I was able to describe commonalities and differences across their views. I could then use their discussions of their learnings in the Diversity Literacy Program or other professional development to get a better sense of how they thought about these beliefs. IPA calls for analyzing an experience in many ways and through various lenses, including frameworks like Critical Race Theory. This study looked at teacher perceptions of the relationshipbuilding process with students while considering cultural identities. 

Moreover, by looking through the lens of Critical Race Theory, this study described how teacher participants employed an element of critical reflection on the role their cultural identities played in their processes of relationship-building. Asking the teacher participants to think about their own cultural identities, particularly in the areas of high expectations and caring, prompted a deeper reflection of how the teachers described the ways they navigated their own experiences to make cross-cultural relationships function well with students whose cultural identities differed from theirs. 

Using CRT as a framework informed how I thought about the critical nature of the teachers' self-reflections. There were several tenets of CRT (Delgado & Stefancic, 2001) that were most pertinent to data analysis. Tenet one, the idea that race and racism are permanent, and that discrimination is a "normal" part of society (p. 7) was central to the teachers' descriptions of their own culturally-situated norms for building positive relationships with students. In several instances their descriptions of how they connected with the diverse personalities in their classrooms considered the effects of institutionalized and systemic racism or various "otherisms" (sexism, classism, etc.). 

Tenet two of CRT, a challenge to dominant ideologies, was seen in scenarios where the participants expressed pushback towards lesson plans or school rules that they felt were not inclusive to all students. This second tenet ties into the third, interest convergence, which was observed when the teachers wrestled with themselves and their own choices. In some scenarios, the participants questioned whether their processes were promoting their own self-interests. Intersectionality and anti-essentialism (tenet five) were lenses through which I reviewed the teachers' descriptions about students' multiple identities. 

CRT's eighth tenet, a commitment to social justice, was the through line most obvious in the teachers' analysis of their relationship-building processes. Consideration of these tenets of CRT supported my thinking about when the participants were reflecting on their own cultural identities, learnings from the DLP, or another new knowledge to describe a situation. In many instances, the teachers described reflection on a tenet of CRT without calling it out by name. These hints at CRT across their reflections allowed me to review the data through that critical lens.

This section will describe how teachers thought about their own cultural identities during the relationship-building process in addition to the beliefs and strategies they described related to navigating student cultural identities to build positive relationships. I will include a discussion of any knowledge obtained from the Diversity Literacy Program or other professional development resources that influenced the participants' beliefs and practices. Finally, I will describe implications for future learning through teacher preparation programs and professional development.

## Teacher Self-Perceptions

The first research question asked how four teachers with certificates in diversity literacy think about their own personal racial, ethnic, and linguistic identities during the process of relationship-building? Although the interview protocol included specific questions about each of these identities, the teachers tended to lump aspects of their identities into what they referred to as "cultural identities." The teacher participants mostly took an intersectional approach, however, to varying degrees, they parsed out aspects of their own and student identities that were most salient as they related to specific situations. I was not able to directly hear conversations between teachers and students, so I relied exclusively on participants' descriptions of their experiences.

## Evolving And Intertwined

The teachers' descriptions of their own cultural identities were closely aligned to the concept of a cultural identity as explained by Banks (2001) and Ndura (2004). Specifically, each participant tended to view their cultural identity as an "evolving phenomenon" (Ndura, 2004, p. 14), constantly being re-realized through interactions with their students and with the deeper theoretical and content knowledge gleaned from their various professional development opportunities and university courses. Throughout the interviews and self-reflections, all four teachers indicated some level of personal and professional growth around developing a more complex understanding of their students' cultural backgrounds and experiences by investigating their own. Their descriptions of ever-evolving perspectives about themselves and their students reflected Cabrera's (2018) argument that the "social world is not static, but is constructed by people with words, stories, and also silences" (p. 16).

Participants described their willingness to question their biases or beliefs when doing so translated into better relationships with their students. Ms. Taylor's reconsideration of her language patterns was a clear example of this. She was unaware that she was appropriating AAVE because she had experiences in her past that reinforced to her that it was acceptable to speak in this way. However, after her experience in the linguistics course, she began to question her experience and was open-minded to students who confirmed that her communication style felt disrespectful. She worked to reevaluate her own cultural identity as it related to language in order to more effectively build positive relationships with her students.

This idea of reconsideration or renegotiation of identity aligned with Heidegger's vision of Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) as marked by "worldliness" and "intersubjectivity" (Smith et al., 2009, p. 17). The participants thought about their identities in these two ways because they were constantly describing their experiences in relation to the world at large and within the context of their relationships with their students. Vygotsky's (1978) vision of sociocultural theory also demonstrated that learning begins as an external, social process which becomes more internalized and individualized as learners grow. Sociocultural theory posited that learning is culturally situated. This concept helped support an understanding of how the participants developed their own cultural identities and compared them to those of their students. 

A clear example of the intertwined and evolving nature of one's cultural identity was seen through Ms. Horton's realization that she had large gaps in her knowledge of the issues facing her LGBTQ+ students. Prior to taking classes in women and gender studies, stereotypes and systems of oppression related to gender and sexuality were things she never considered. The realization that she never had to think about this facet of her identity and her pivot to learn more about it in order to support her students showed that her understanding of her own identity evolved to respond to the needs of her students. Her sexual identity or gender expression were not things she considered to be salient features of her cultural identity, until she began seeing how unavoidable those features were for students who live outside the mythical norm (Lorde, 1984) of heteronormativity. In addition to the content knowledge which deepened her awareness of sexual identity and gender expression, she began becoming more cognizant of issues in her school that had to do with supporting her trans and nonbinary students. 

Ms. Horton's desire to learn more in order to support her students reflected Kleinfeld's (1975) findings about effective White teachers of Students of Color. Kleinfeld argued that one of the main reasons White teachers are considered ineffective is because they perpetuate hegemonic viewpoints and even "personify antagonistic values'' (p. 304) of oppressive White culture. Ms. Horton, on the other hand, took a gap in her knowledge and identified it as an area for growth. She recognized that even though discrimination plaguing the LGBTQ+ community did not directly impact her; it was important for her to read up on the topic to better understand the experiences of her students. 

This reflected Merleau-Ponty's (Smith et al., 2009) concept of "embodied perspective" within IPA. Embodied perspective looks at an experience through the lens of difference, recognizing that the perception of "other" reflects the way one sees themself. In this case, Ms. Horton determined that her students' sexual and gender identities were not representative of her experience. The judgement associated with living outside of the heteronormative "norm" was something she personally "never had to think about before." Merleau-Ponty argues that one's experience belongs to their "embodied position" (p. 19) in the world, the way their physical body is perceived and analyzed by society. Through this perspective, although one will never fully understand another's experience, one can compare it to their own body-in-the-world experience. Ms. Horton's comparison led her to understand that although she does not personally experience discrimination related to her sexuality or relationship status, it was important for her understand her students by learning more about and supporting their experiences.

All participants demonstrated a cognizance that there were overlapping aspects of their cultural identities, articulating a belief in the concept of intersectionality. Intersectionality, in their descriptions, consisted of any of the identities they possessed, including race, gender, religion, socioeconomic status, marital status, and sexual identity. Their discussions of their identities related to their students were framed as intersectional; they mentioned distinct differences between themselves and their students related to various aspects of their identities. For instance, Ms. Carter, the only Black teacher in this study, indicated that it is important for her to understand her own and her students' ethnic identities. As noted previously, Ms. Carter sought to learn about her own ancestry and invested in a DNA kit to learn where her family was from. This desire to learn about herself and her students beyond their racial identities was clearly important to Ms. Carter. She consistently ensured students were free to discuss their heritage and incorporated lessons reflecting students' identities into her unit on the Lunar New Year where students were able to share and teach other students about their ethnic heritages. 

Ms. Taylor's focus on intersectionality extended to the activities she completed with her students on the first few days of school. She routinely took time to ask students questions about their backgrounds and invited discussions of what she referred to as "dimensions of diversity." Because she taught at a school with a high population of refugee and immigrant students, she also made distinctions between her students related to their countries of origin or ethnic identities. For example, she intentionally asked students about regional language dialects and worked to learn more about individual student customs and cultures. Specifically, she discussed working to understand cultural conflicts between her students from different African countries, to know where there might be future issues between students. She described prompting other teachers to deepen their understanding of intersectionality. This was specifically related to helping other teachers see that students from the same country could be as different from each other as they are from students from a totally different country. 

All the teachers saw their broader cultural identities as intertwined aspects situated within their racial identities. They described strategies related to ethnic, socioeconomic, and linguistic identities. These references tended to be situated within their racial identities. The teachers framed discussion of cultural identities in an intersectional way, hinting at tenet five of Critical Race Theory (intersectionality and anti-essentialism). They also all discussed the pervasiveness of race and racism in their classrooms (CRT tenet one), while also recognizing that race is only one component of people's lives (CRT tenet five). One example of this would be the way that Ms. Taylor thought about her linguistic identity as being situated in her experience as a White woman. Ms. Horton also started the description of her cultural identity off by saying that she saw herself as a "White woman from Northern Indiana," with all her other identities (socioeconomic, etc.) stemming from that description. 

The teacher participants focused on how they felt their racial identities impacted their experience as teachers, particularly during the process of relationship-building. This was likely because racial identity is often the most visible difference between the teachers and their students, the feature of their identity that is obvious from the moment they meet students. Ms. Carter used her "centrality of experiential knowledge" (Delgado & Stefancic, 2001) as an African American woman, harkening back to the seventh tenet of CRT, to connect with her Students of Color. She described listening to the voices of her Students of Color who identified as Muslim in order to maintain flexibility in her physical education classes. Her experience with feeling discriminated against for not wanting to participate in water sports due to her hair connected her with Muslim students who could not participate fully in some aspects of her class due to their traditional dress. She used her body-in-the-world experiences (Smith et al., 2009) to connect with her students by not questioning their choices and beliefs. 

## Different, But Good

A common theme throughout the data was that all four teacher participants recognized differences within their identities that did not align with their students. This was most clearly observed in the White teachers' discussions of racial differences. They all expressed a similar understanding that many of their childhood and formative experiences were informed by normative White structures, what Inoue (2015), building off a term from Bourdieu (1977), refers to as a "White racial habitus" (p. 16). This term refers to a "historically organizing set of structures that structure social interactions and society" (p. 42). For the White teachers, the ways that they were taught about discipline, high expectations and caring were all situated in a White normative dynamic of which they were keenly aware. This also reflected Merleau-Ponty's (Smith et al., 2009) concept of "embodied perspective" within IPA.

Inoue (2015) argues that a White racial habitus can be seen in three spaces: 
discursively or linguistically, materially and bodily, and performatively. In this study I found evidence in the teachers' descriptions of themselves, particularly in their descriptions of interactions with students that revealed parts of themselves, that they were especially aware of the normative White structures of society that they were either raised in or currently operated in. Many of these descriptions fit into Inuoe's three spaces. For instance, Ms. Taylor felt that she was informed by her background to think that her middle class, White, norms of conversation were correct, and that anything else was perceived as interrupting or disrespectful. This was evidenced through her anecdote about teaching middle school, where she felt overwhelmed by the linguistic styles of her African American students, to the point where she tried to quiet them down in favor of making sure the White students in her class felt comfortable. 

This anecdote reflected what Okun & Jones (2001) describe as a trait of White supremacy culture, this idea of White students' "right to comfort" (Okun & Jones, 2001, as cited in Germán, 2020, p. 11). Ms. Taylor's most salient conflict with her White racial habitus was related to language. She knew it was not right that she was setting up structures where the comfort of White students was held in higher regard than the conversational norms and styles of her Students of Color. She recognized that this choice was causing problems in the way that she viewed students and connected with them. She spoke of this time before she began learning more about topics like language diversity and linguistic justice (Baker-Bell, 2017) as "cringy." She argued that her feelings about linguistic hierarchies were an embarrassing part of her past now that she has committed to learning more and doing better by changing her behaviors. 

Ms. Taylor's growing cognizance of linguistic hierarchies reiterated the concept that there is no one "true" English, and further, no one "right" way to communicate with and connect to others. Culture and society have shaped a version of the "truth" about Standard English and communication styles through adherence to "mythical norms" of language (Lorde, 1984). Mythical norms in the classroom include beliefs about how normative conversations should look, including instances like the "sage on the stage" construct of teaching, where the instructor is the font of knowledge who pours information into the minds of students. Inuoe referred to this as a White racial habitus, or a dominant white discourse, which we might for now understand as a set of linguistic codes and textual markers that are often not a part of the discourses of many Students of Color, working class students, and multilingual students, but is a part of many white, middle-class students' discourses (p. 17). 

In classroom situations where teachers do not understand how dominant White discourse has been normatized, students who veer from this type of speech could be seen as lacking or inferior. Kleinfeld (1975) identified silence as defiance in Eskimo cultures, whereas many teachers who do not understand important nuances between language varieties or cultural forms of language expression may incorrectly understand silence to represent student focus and attention. Ms. Taylor expressed an understanding that no one language or communication style should be prized over another because there is no such thing as a "master" or "true" English (Lyotard et al., 1984). This was something she admitted to learning over time, as it was not something she grew up understanding within her normative White experience. 

Ms. Horton also spoke to how her "life experiences" differed from those of her students, particularly her past and current socioeconomic statuses. This was reflective of Inoue's (2015) performative category of White racial habitus, demonstrated through ways people are perceived as acting in society (in this case, related to money). It also spoke to embodied perspective in that it looked at social status through the lens of difference (Smith et al., 2009). Ms. Horton mentioned her upbringing affording her various things like a college education and access to resources like athletics. She saw these differences as being distinct from the experiences of most of her students. Ms. Horton also specifically mentioned developing a deeper understanding of her identities after her experiences in the Diversity Literacy Program. As previously mentioned, she began understanding more about the LGBTQ+ community and recognized that she needed to spend more time thinking about how something like sexual identity impacted students' classroom experiences.

Ms. Carter recognized and celebrated differences by asking students to share in restorative circles. For her, learning about students' identities was an important part of her content. She mentioned specifically needing to know about students' religion related to how they may choose to dress (or not dress) for PE. She described students wearing hijabs or shoes and attire that were not well-suited for athletics. Ms. Carter demonstrated critical consciousness (Freire, 1970) by identifying systems of oppression in her classroom (required dress) and seeking to change them. An element of criticality was also observed in her practices like proactive planning (asking students to share about their cultures and making lessons around that information) and frequent self-critique. 

Mr. Bowman's incident with the student who spread a rumor about him indicated his understanding that differences do not inherently cause problems. He told the student, "I can fully attest to the fact that my personal life has no influence on how well I'm going to teach you." This displayed his belief that a perceived negative aspect of his personal life was not going to have a negative impact on his ability to connect with his students. In this scenario, Mr. Bowman did not jump to a conclusion that the student was homophobic or that their relationship could not be positive because of this identity clash. He worked professionally to get to the bottom of the situation and was proud that it ended on such a positive note. HE hoped that the student learned an important lesson about relationship boundaries and respecting differences.

Although all the teachers recognized that they had cultural identities that were different from those of their students, they did not think about these differences as deficits. They also felt that in the same way that their own identities did not have to have a negative impact on how they will teach, that student identities did not have to have a negative impact on their ability to learn. Even when the teachers felt that their identities were at odds with those of their students, they still did not assume there could not be a relationship or that they would never see eye-to-eye with a student. 

This belief in the value of students' cultural identities was reflective of Yosso's 
(2005) discussion of community cultural wealth. Yosso "conceptualizes community cultural wealth as a critical race theory (CRT) challenge to traditional interpretations of cultural capital" (p. 69). She argues that throughout history, People of Color have been viewed through a deficit lens, which looks at their traits and knowledge as "less than" or "incomplete." She connects this larger deficit perspective to the way Students of Color are viewed in many classrooms as lacking. Throughout the interviews and selfreflections, participants viewed their students' cultural differences as assets and not deficits. They used their unique knowledge bases to plan lessons, like in the case of Ms. Carter, who invited her student to present on the Lunar New Year. Ms. Taylor consistently valued student experiences and linguistic varieties by making them part of her "getting to know you" lessons and by celebrating her students' cultural capital. 

Participants discussed how the ways they think about cultural differences impact their classrooms. They consistently discussed the concept of intersectionality, the idea that experiences are not monolithic even when there are cultural similarities between teachers and students. Similarly, the teachers all identified that their concepts of high expectations and care were framed by their cultural identities and experiences. They did not feel that the differences did not create a barrier in their ability to connect with students. These differences will be explored more specifically in the second half of this chapter. 

## Teacher Perceptions Of Students And Navigation Of Relationship-Building

The second question investigated through this research study was "In what ways do teachers describe how they navigate cultural differences to convey sentiments of high expectations and care to their students in order to build positive relationships?" In many instances, the literature uses the two concepts (high expectations and care) interchangeably, demonstrating that the qualities are often inextricably linked. Unless noted specifically, I will describe the concepts separately as they relate to the findings.

## Knowing Me, Knowing You

All participants spoke of grounding themselves in a deep understanding of their own cultural identities as the first step in the process of positive relationship-building. This is a critical piece of IPA which said that a "phenomenological attitude involves and requires a reflexive move, as we turn our gaze…towards our perception" (Smith et al., 2009, p. 12). The teachers constantly kept coming back to their personal frames of references, noting times when their experiences did not align with those of their students and discussing ways that they navigated those differences to build or maintain a positive relationship. Using these differences as a starting point, all the participants then crafted experiences to connect with and understand their students more fully. 

There were a variety of intentional strategies that each of the teachers described enacting as during their process of relationship-building related to getting to know students and sharing parts of themselves. For each of the teachers, having some form of an ice breaker or "getting-to-know-you" activity was important to begin developing relationships with students. These ranged from simple questions designed to get students talking and engaged with one another to more active games that allowed students to move around. These activities were described by the teachers as purposeful avenues to learn student names and understand something unique about each student. In this way, they aimed to build trust and connection between themselves and their students. This echoed Noddings' (1988) findings which indicated that "children will work harder for people they love and trust'' (p. 10). Things (or strategies) like playing a game with students or asking them simple questions about themselves built love and trust. 

The teachers' intentional attempts to understand students on deeper levels showed that caring in the classroom also included engagement in students' personal lives and experiences. Students in Howard's (2001) study indicated that they could tell if a teacher cared about them when they ask questions about what is going on at home, trying to get a sense of the unique experiences of every student. Hollins and Spencer (1990) similarly found that African American elementary and secondary students indicated that when teachers were responsive to their personal lives, they felt more connected to the classroom and expressed more positive sentiments and increased effort in their academics. 

The participants enacted what Pollock (2017) described as "deep" culture talk. 

Looking at students in a "shallow" manner would consist of viewing cultural groups as similar or bound by certain characteristics. They described viewing each of their students as distinct individuals even when they were part of the same ethnic, religion, racial, or other group as a different student. Ms. Taylor spoke to this concept directly when she discussed other teachers' perceptions of her refugee students. She argued that just because two students are from the same home country, it does not mean they have the same characteristics, understandings, and experiences. She recognized that these students could have been on very different sides of the conflict in their home countries and putting them together for assignments or tasks could pose larger problems. She "challenged nouns" (p. 176) as Pollock (2017) referred to it. For instance, when someone classified her students into groups like "Africans" or "Asians," she encouraged the person to think about understanding the student as an individual instead of lumping them into a larger cultural identity that may not fit them. 

Mr. Bowman similarly challenged "shallow" (Pollock, 2017) cultural reflections by bringing diverse concepts and readings into his English classroom. When allowed the opportunity he chooses contemporary novels and stories that portray a wide variety of experiences. Mr. Bowman demonstrated critical consciousness by saying that to combat stereotypes about a certain culture or group he will intentionally choose texts for his course that challenges the perceptions. When his curriculum was not as flexible, he described encouraging students to find personal connections in more outdated readings. This included tying an older text like *The Crucible* to the Black Lives Matter or LGBTQ+ movements. This demonstrated the use of counterstory (CRT tenet seven) as a tool to allow students to analyze texts through the centrality of their own experiences (Martinez, 2020). 

One of the major ways the participants described navigating diverse identities to build relationships was through their negotiation of the concept of "respect." All the teachers used this idea of respect as a starting point to build foundational relationships with their students. Mr. Bowman described his process for fostering respect as "intentional" and one that he believed must involve all students. hooks (1994) described this strategy as using "cultural codes," which are teaching strategies that promote multicultural learning through reflection on students as individuals. This allowed the teacher to learn what students consider to be important or truths. Mr. Bowman focused a lot on the classroom community, believing that most of his students must be engaged and feel respected for that respect to be reflected in the class overall. The participants' viewed respect as being culturally situated and different depending on the student. Their descriptions of respect included an element of learning students' cultural codes and sharing their own in order to create a space where student perspectives and identities were shared and validated. 

Ms. Horton had a similar view of respect, arguing that it required putting work into the relationship. She compared respect to a bank account that must have routine deposits. As a coach, Ms. Horton saw building a classroom environment built on mutual respect as a community obligation, a space where students needed to be invited to engage and be "called in." By creating a collective team environment in her classroom, Ms. Horton helped students see that they are part of a larger circle of respect and trust. Ladson-Billings (1994) described the impact of "social power" (p. 160) in the classroom, arguing that when students feel valued and respected, they are more likely to be successful. Gay spoke of the concept of a "mutual aid society" (p. 110) which is a community of learners engaging in cooperative efforts. Ms. Taylor and Ms. Carter also indicated that creating an environment built on respect is a cooperative effort as well. Both discussed needing to give respect to students first in order to receive it, and that concept of respect must be revisited and reinforced throughout the school year. The negotiation of respect in the teachers' classrooms was a community effort to include all students in the classroom environment. 

Another intentional strategy the teachers enacted was to make their classrooms welcoming environments for students. Ms. Taylor decorated her classroom in an inviting way by bringing plants, lighting from home, beautiful art, and essential oils into her classroom. She imitated the environment that makes her feel most comfortable and excited about learning, hoping that her passion and comfortable space made her students feel at peace. She described crafting her classroom as a "yes space," which meant that it was an environment that was proactive and positive. She explained that this meant having her classroom be inviting to students so that they knew where items are, what the rules were, and where they were able to move around freely. She said that because students were clear on the expectations, she didn't have to spend time disciplining them for small issues like leaving their seat or not following masking protocols; they typically just followed the rules since they were so clear. This contributed to her classroom being a more positive and inviting space.

Mr. Bowman described his classroom as a "shrine to diversity" with pride flags and other decorations that he hoped would help students know that it is a welcoming environment for them. In one instance, Mr. Bowman's choice of decor, posters representing diverse cultures, became a source of contention between himself and another student as described more fully in Chapter 4. Mr. Bowman's choice to move the posters to a different spot in his room the next year demonstrated a desire to see the difference in opinion in this situation not as a deficit, but as a space where he and the student could come together and build a mutual understanding, with the goal of maintaining a positive relationship. He also considered the larger demographic landscape of his classroom and would not consider removing the posters entirely as they represented many of his students. 

## Teacher Vulnerability

Expressing vulnerability emerged as a common theme throughout the teachers' interviews and self-reflections. Vulnerability as described by participants was multifaceted and a necessary part of building positive relationships with students. Bullough (2005) argued that "vulnerability is part of teaching, teachers manage it differently, and these differences have profound importance for teachers and their development, students and their learning, and teacher educators and their practice" (p. 23). He described vulnerability as having several functions for educators. First, vulnerability can be viewed as a way of offsetting worry, allowing a teacher the possibility of being hurt, perhaps to cushion the inevitable blow of difficult school scenarios: a disgruntled conversation with a parent or an unpleasant interaction with an administrator. Ms. Taylor described the idea as a "defense mechanism," something that teachers enacted when they did not feel comfortable examining difficult situations or trying new strategies to connect with students. By maintaining a certain level of vulnerability, educators can prepare themselves for the constant pressures that come with the job. In many ways, the resilience that new teachers must overcome these pressures may have an impact on which teachers continue within the career. Being vulnerable, in this sense, might help teachers put the stressors of the job into perspective, and assist them in not getting too overwhelmed. 

Bullough also argued that other teachers see vulnerability as a way to take risks in the classroom, and to give themselves a certain level of freedom to feel comfortable thwarting failure. If a teacher allowed themselves to be vulnerable during a lesson, they may be able to deal with issues that arise, for example, if students do not learn the material or they act out due to ineffective management strategies or lack of engagement, etc. For Bullough, vulnerability was experienced by teachers in a slightly negative way, as an unfortunate repercussion of a job that demanded a lot from various stakeholders. One of the major themes of his research on vulnerability indicated that many teachers may view vulnerability as a technique for self-preservation (p. 33). 

In other literature, particularly related to Critical Race Theory (CRT) and antiracist teaching, vulnerability can be seen in a more positive light, as a challenge to dominant ideologies and a way to maintain openness and avoid being defensive. As it pertains to CRT, vulnerability can be seen as a way to challenge a variety of school structures, including but not limited to rigid standards and content requirements and discipline policies. Vulnerability here was described as allowing oneself to be open to critique when assigning a "nontraditional" text outside of the Western Canon or teaching a lesson on melanin and the biological factors that contribute to one's skin color instead of doing rote Punnett squares. One is opening themselves up to the possibility that their administration, or students, may not be supportive or engaged in the types of choices being made in the classroom. But part of the vulnerability was recognizing that when it comes to educational and institutional injustice, while procedures and regulations "claim neutrality" (Martinez, 2020, p. 11), this often meant "justifying a passing over of People of Color" (p. 11). 

Okun & Jones (2001) described as a trait of White supremacy culture the idea of defensiveness which is counter to the concept of vulnerability (as cited in Germán, 2020, p. 11). Defensiveness in the classroom was described as policies and procedures geared towards intensive prevention policies like "three strikes and you're out," inflexible rules, aversion to suggestions, and denial of personal bias or mistakes. Vulnerability, on the other hand, appeared as teachers recognizing that power structures exist in their schools and communities, and working to make space for students to consider ideas outside of what is normative (Germán, 2020). It also looked like actively naming defensiveness as an issue in the classroom and encouraging students to be vulnerable and open to different perspectives as well. This was quite difficult for teachers to do because defensiveness is so ingrained in various teaching practices, including stringent rules and school-wide norms. In many ways, teachers may be afraid to be vulnerable for fear that they will relinquish power and be seen by their administration as ineffective. 

In line with the tenets of CRT and anti-racist teaching, participants identified vulnerability not as a negative aspect of their teaching experience, but as one of the most powerful tools they leveraged while building relationships. They leaned more into the possibilities that vulnerability could provide in the classroom. Specifically, they identified vulnerability as giving them a way to feel humanized and like they were opening themselves up to connection with students, instead of preserving themselves from the possibility of negative confrontation. For Mr. Bowman, someone showing care looked like individualized attention, which allowed for a more vulnerable interaction. By having a moment alone, he argued that you can really feel comfortable expressing what is on your mind and connecting with that person more fully. 

The teacher participants were comfortable negotiating their power to build equitable and positive relationships with students. This is important because Bullough's (2005) research indicated that "the quest for self-protection in the face of vulnerability" can lead teachers to place the blame on students or factors outside of themselves when things do not go as planned. This quest for self-protection was directly aligned with Okun & Jones' (2001) concept of defensiveness, and can be seen as a way teachers, oftentimes White teachers, work to preserve their claims of neutrality and fairness. By leaning into the positive aspects of vulnerability, instead of using it to build a wall between themselves and students, participants demonstrated how openness to critique and change can be beneficial in the relationship-building process. This was also reflective of the concept of critical consciousness (Freire, 1970), which requires frequent self-critique and an effort to dismantle systems of oppression. 

Ms. Taylor described vulnerability as "modeling risk taking." She argued that this goes both ways: she was very open to being wrong and making mistakes and she expected that from her students as well. Palmer (2007) argued that "as we try to connect ourselves and our subjects with our students, we make ourselves, as well as our subjects, vulnerable to indifference, judgment, ridicule" (p. 17). For Ms. Taylor, risk-taking was a normal part of the classroom experience. She set up a classroom environment where there were constant reminders that everyone messes up, and that this does not mean you are less than, unintelligent, or always going to make mistakes. She extended this vulnerability beyond her classroom by inviting critique from her administrators.

This tied into Okun & Jones' (2001) concept of perfectionism, which they argue is another trait of White supremacy culture. Too often, they explain, it is more common in classrooms to point out someone's mistakes in a mocking way or to perceive mistakes as something deeper than just a simple slip up. Ms. Taylor directly combatted this perfectionist attitude by developing a culture of appreciation for where students were, including the mistakes they were making in their quest for knowledge and understanding. She reiterated Okun & Jones' (2001) beliefs that it is important to "help students know that mistakes are expected and are opportunities for growth" (p. 13). 

Ms. Horton said that she models vulnerability by owning up to mistakes. She contrasted this with "talking bad" about someone, indicating her belief that mistakes are normal and "seen as separate from the person not as defining traits" (Okun & Jones, 2001, as cited in Germán, 2020, p. 13). She discussed boundaries when speaking about vulnerability, tying together her beliefs that vulnerability is something that must be modeled with students, but that it does have some clear boundaries. For instance, she reiterated that she would not let vulnerability extend to extremely personal topics, mostly about herself. She was open to students sharing whatever they felt comfortable speaking about with her, but when it came to intimate details about her personal life, this moved from vulnerability to possible inappropriateness with students. 

This concept of "inappropriateness" reiterated what Ms. Carter described as relationship boundaries that thwart "unethical" or "nasty stuff." Ms. Horton said that she "screens" herself, and topics that make her feel uncomfortable (mostly related to personal relationships as she goes on to explain) she intentionally moves beyond. She also tied vulnerability to transparency and authenticity in many of her interviews and selfreflections. She articulated the belief that by being authentic, while also honoring and recognizing the diverse identities of students, she could be an effective teacher despite cultural differences. 

Ms. Carter demonstrated vulnerability in her lesson planning. She kept reiterating that she was learning along with her students, and that when she put together topics based on cultural experiences like Black History Month or The Lunar New Year, she always let students know that she was a learner, too. She told students they would probably know more than her about some of the topics, and that they should feel comfortable interjecting or adding to the lessons. She noted that this is often exactly what students did, and this incorporation of student voice into the lessons made students feel more involved in the lesson and also created a safe space where even the teacher could be critiqued for being wrong about a topic. This, in turn, helped build relationships because it gave students permission to be wrong, to fail, as well. Chavez (2021) explained that this type of openness to listening to the voices of Students of Color in the classroom created a more empowering experience for students. This allowed for a shattering of the "matrix of silence" (p. 3) that so many Students of Color in schools routinely felt when they were not invited to share their experiences openly. 

Palmer (2007) described this vulnerability by saying "Good teachers join self, and subject, and students in the fabric of life" (p. 11). Ms. Carter consistently credited the use of restorative circles and the inclusion of student voice as ways that she created spaces for trust and respect. Mr. Bowman also described vulnerability in his lesson planning through his use of "low stakes" and "opinion-based" writing. He gave students prompts with flexible parameters, allowing them to use their own distinct voices to answer questions such as How does fear drive decision-making? He explained that he goes into these prompts with no expectations other than students argue their points clearly and substantively. This commitment to the centrality of experiential knowledge (Delgado & Stefancic, 2001) in Ms. Carter's and Mr. Bowman's teaching provided a way for students to be legitimate and authoritarian sources on their experiences, instead of being told about their own cultures by someone in a position of power (Martinez, 2020). 

Mr. Bowman's English classroom functioned as a space for both himself and his students to exercise freedom in their writing processes. As opposed to typical writing workshops that cater "to (white) creativity, (white) imagination, and (white) autonomy on the page" (Chavez, 2021, p. 95), Mr. Bowman did not just allow, but encouraged his students to include personal anecdotes and experiences within their writing. Mr. Bowman's writing prompts and activities were reflective of Chavez' anti-racist writing model workshop, where students are able to "vent, and risk-take, and confess our fears, and riff off one another, and most of all wander" (p. 97). While he did not mention an explicit understanding of this type of workshop model, Mr. Bowman's involvement with the \#DisruptTexts movement (Germán, 2020) and his general understanding of anti-racist teaching practices from his diversity literacy courses were reflected in his classroom. They were seen especially in the freedom of expression he allowed his students in their creative processes, in addition to the encouragement he gave students to question dominant ideologies in the Eurocentric texts they were required to read (CRT tenet two). This was reflective of Martinez' (2020) argument that a focus on inclusion and equity is important, but that "it is equally important to include the admission of critical selfreflection on privilege and to use this privilege to be an accomplice" (p. 17).

The type of vulnerability the teachers described in their interviews and selfreflections mirrored the "vulnerability as strength" framework that Shim (2020) outlined in her investigation of three White male teachers engaged in an antiracist project. Her study followed the three educators while they engaged in critical self-reflections and documented experiences related to Whiteness in their everyday lives. The study showed that as the participants investigated their Whiteness, these discoveries would help them be better teachers of Students of Color. The data from the study indicated that teachers who engage in critical self-reflection often experience sensations of vulnerability. In Shim's study, this expression of vulnerability was marked by feelings of self-doubt and emotions related to the participants' developing understanding of their privilege related to being White. 

Shim (2020) discovered that when her participants continued to reflect on their feelings of vulnerability, they realized that these were not actually sentiments that made them feel weak. Conversely, participants explained that they found their vulnerability to be necessary, and that it was an indication that they were being honest with themselves. Shim noted that the participants were in the midst of a transition where they found "raced spaces" coupled with spaces for learning (p. 353). Coming to terms with their own identities as White educators allowed the participants to take their vulnerability and move from a state of ambivalence towards issues related to race and racism, to a position more aligned to antiracist advocacy. 

This type of understanding and movement towards vulnerability instead of away from it was something that the participants described learning in the Diversity Literacy Program. In this way, vulnerability was a specific trait identified by the participants as a requirement of an educator's social justice work. Bullough (2005) noted that for some teachers, "it feels good to be stretched and to gain in competence" (p. 33). This was the type of vulnerability participants described feeling when it came to being more competent in diversity literacy. For Ms. Horton in particular, she continued to express thankfulness for the program which allowed her to identify and fill gaps in her knowledge, most specifically related to LGBTQ+ issues. Ms. Horton displayed a clear cognizance that it is important for her as a teacher to reach out to find additional knowledge ("academically" and "socially") to add to her framework for her learning and understanding of diverse student identities.
